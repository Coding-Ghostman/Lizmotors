The
Impact
of
Covid-19
and
the
Russia-Ukraine
War
on

to
be
significantly
influenced

two
major
factors:
The
Russia-Ukraine

has
created
political
and
economic

a
decline
in

Additionally,

Sustainability
Focus
and
Eco-Friendly
Material
The
market
for
canoes
and
kayaks
is
being
impacted
by
environmental
awareness.
Manufacturers
are
utilizing
recycled
materials,
implementing
sustainable
procedures,
and
investigating
bio-based
substitutes
for
conventional
polyethylene
or
fiberglass.
The
need
for
firms
with
strong
sustainability
pledges
is
being
driven
by
consumers'
rising
desire
for
eco-friendly
solutions,
such
as
wooden
kayaks
or
bamboo
paddles.
The
market
is
faced
with
both
possibilities
and
problems
as
a
result
of
this
trend,
which
calls
for
innovation
and
distinction
in
manufacturing
methods
and
materials.

Citing
a
report
produced
by
Beyond
Market
Insights,
FinancialNewsMedia.com
reported
this
week
that
growth
of
the
electric
vehicle
industry
and
EV
market
is
expected
to
accelerate
quickly
in
the
coming
decade.
The
global
EV
market,
which
was
worth
about
$178.5
billion
in
2021,
has
been
projected
to
grow
to
around
$1.1
trillion
by
2030
with
a
compound
annual
growth
rate
of
roughly
22.5%,
the
outlet
reported.
It
said
exceptional
growth
is
anticipated
in
both
the
private
and
commercial
sectors.
Canoo,
an
EV
company
with
a
stake
in
Oklahoma,
was
cited
as
a
market
player.
‚??The
commercial
fleets
segment
is
expected
to
grow
significantly
in
the
global
electric
vehicle
market
during
the
projection
period.
Rising
fuel
prices,
tight
environmental
restrictions
enforced
by
governments,
increased
usage
of
autonomous
delivery
vehicles,
and
increased
use
of
electric
buses
and
trucks
are
all
contributing
to
this
market‚??s
strong
rise,‚?ù
it
said.
‚??The
major
companies
in
the
electric
vehicle
market
have
moved
their
attention
to
product
production
and
are
launching
important
tactics
including
mergers,
acquisitions,
and
joint
ventures
with
domestic
and
major
players
to
expand
their
product
offerings
and
solidify
their
market
position
globally.‚?ù
Canoo
Inc.
recently
said
it
would
build
a
battery
manufacturing
facility
at
Pryor
to
complement
other
plans
for
building
vehicles
in
Oklahoma.
The
site
noted
that
Canoo
will
be
the
first
EV
company
to
produce
battery
modules
using
hydropower
from
the
Grand
River
Dam
Authority.
The
company‚??s
new
battery
manufacturing
facility
will
be
in
the
same
industrial
park
as
its
future
‚??MegaMicro‚?ù
factory.

materialize
or
our
assumptions
prove
incorrect,
actual
results
could
differ
materially
from
the
results
implied
by

There
may
be
additional
risks
that

events
and
views

of
the
date

release.
Canoo
anticipates
that
subsequent
events
and
developments
will
cause
Canoo's
assessments
to
change.
However,
while
Canoo
may
elect
to
update
these
forward-looking
statements
at
some
point
in
the
future,
Canoo
specifically
disclaims
any

so.

Below
is
a
sample
report
to
help
you
understand
the
structure
of
the
report
you
are
buying
GlobalData
provides
a
great
range
of
information
and
reports
on
various
sectors
that
is
highly
relevant,
timely,
easy
to
access
and
utilise.
The
reports
and
data
dashboards
help
engagement
with
clients;
they
provide
valuable
industry
and
market
insights
that
can
enrich
client
conversations
and
can
help
in
the
shaping
of
value
propositions.
Moreover,
using
GlobalData
products
has
helped
increase
my
knowledge
of
the
finance
sector,
the
players
within
it,
and
the
general
threats
and
opportunities.
I
find
the
consumer
surveys
that
are
carried
out
to
be
extremely
beneficial
and
not
something
I
have
seen
anywhere
else.
They
provided
an
insightful
view
of
why
and
which
consumers
take
(or
don‚??t)
particular
financial
products.
This
can
help
shape
conversations
with
clients
to
ensure
they
make
the
right
strategic
decisions
for
their
business.
One
of
the
challenges
I
have
found
is
that
data
in
the
payments
space
is
often
piecemeal.
With
GD
all
of
the
data
I
need
is
in
one
place,
but
it
also
comes
with
additional
market
reports
that
provide
useful
extra
context
and
information.
Having
the
ability
to
set-up
alerts
on
relevant
movements
in
the
industry,
be
it
competitors
or
customers,
and
have
them
emailed
directly
to
me,
ensures
I
get
early
sight
of
industry
activity
and
don‚??t
have
to
search
for
news.
‚??The
GlobalData
platform
is
our
go-to
tool
for
intelligence
services.
GlobalData
provides
an
easy
way
to
access
comprehensive
intelligence
data
around
multiple
sectors,
which
essentially
makes
it
a
one-for-all
intelligence
platform,
for
tendering
and
approaching
customers.
GlobalData
is
very
customer
orientated,
with
a
high
degree
of
personalised
services,
which
benefits
everyday
use.
The
highly
detailed
project
intelligence
and
forecast
reports
can
be
utilised
across
multiple
departments
and
workflow
scopes,
from
operational
to
strategic
level,
and
often
support
strategic
decisions.
GlobalData
Analytics
and
visualisation
solutions
has
contributed
positively
when
preparing
management
presentations
and
strategic
papers.‚?ù
‚??COVID-19
has
caused
significant
interference
to
our
business
and
the
COVID-19
intelligence
from
GlobalData
has
helped
us
reach
better
decisions
around
strategy.
These
two
highlights
have
helped
enormously
to
understand
the
projections
into
the
future
concerning
our
business
units,
we
also
utilise
the
project
database
to
source
new
projects
for
Liebherr-Werk
to
use
as
an
additional
source
to
pitch
for
new
business.‚?ù
Your
daily
news
has
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
and
keeps
me
up-to-date
with
what
is
happening
in
the
market,
I
like
that
you
almost
always
have
a
link
to
the
source
origin.
We
also
use
your
market
data
in
our
Strategic
Business
Process
to
support
our
business
decisions.
By
having
everything
in
one
place
on
the
Intelligence
Center
it
has
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
versus
looking
on
different
sources,
the
alert
function
also
helps
with
this.
Having
used
several
other
market
research
companies,
I
find
that
GlobalData
manages
to
provide
that
‚??difficult-to-get‚??
market
data
that
others
can‚??t,
as
well
as
very
diverse
and
complete
consumer
surveys.
Our
experience
with
GlobalData
has
been
very
good,
from
the
platform
itself
to
the
people.
I
find
that
the
analysts
and
the
account
team
have
a
high
level
of
customer
focus
and
responsiveness
and
therefore
I
can
always
rely
on.
The
platform
is
more
holistic
than
other
providers.
It
is
convenient
and
almost
like
a
one
stop
shop.
The
pricing
suite
is
highly
competitive
and
value
for
our
organisation.
I
like
reports
that
inform
new
segments
such
as
the
analysis
on
generation
Z,
millennials,
the
impact
of
COVID
19
to
our
banking
customers
and
their
new
channel
habits.
Secondly
the
specialist
insight
on
affluent
sector
significantly
increases
our
understanding
about
this
group
of
customers.
The
combination
of
those
give
us
depth
and
breadth
of
the
evolving
market.
I‚??m
in
the
business
of
answering
and
helping
people
make
decisions
so
with
the
intelligence
center
I
can
do
that,
effectively
and
efficiently.
I
can
share
quickly
key
insights
that
answer
and
satisfy
our
country
stakeholders
by
giving
them
many
quality
studies
and
primary
research
about
competitive
landscape
beyond
the
outlook
of
our
bank.
It
helps
me
be
seen
as
an
advisory
partner
and
that
makes
a
big
difference.
A
big
benefit
of
our
subscription
is
that
no
one
holds
the
whole
data
and
because

‚??I
know
that
I
can
always
rely
on
Globaldata‚??s
work
when
I‚??m
searching
for
the
right
consumer
and
market
insights.
I
use
Globaldata
insights
to
understand
the
changing
market
&
consumer
landscape
and
help
create
better
taste
&
wellbeing
solutions
for
our
customers
in
food,
beverage
and
healthcare
industries.
Globaldata
has
the
right
data
and
the
reports
are
of
very
high
quality
compared
to
your
competitors.
Globaldata
not
only
has
overall
market
sizes
&
consumer
insights
on
food
&
beverages
but
also
provides
insights
at
the
ingredient
&
flavour
level.
That
is
key
for
B2B
companies
like
Givaudan.
This
way
we
understand
our
customers‚??
business
and
also
gain
insight
to
our
unique
industry‚?ù
GlobalData
provides
a
great
range
of
information
and
reports
on
various
sectors
that
is
highly
relevant,
timely,
easy
to
access
and
utilise.
The
reports
and
data
dashboards
help
engagement
with
clients;
they
provide
valuable
industry
and
market
insights
that
can
enrich
client
conversations
and
can
help
in
the
shaping
of
value
propositions.
Moreover,
using
GlobalData
products
has
helped
increase
my
knowledge
of
the
finance
sector,
the
players
within
it,
and
the
general
threats
and
opportunities.
I
find
the
consumer
surveys
that
are
carried
out
to
be
extremely
beneficial
and
not
something
I
have
seen
anywhere
else.
They
provided
an
insightful
view
of
why
and
which
consumers
take
(or
don‚??t)
particular
financial
products.
This
can
help
shape
conversations
with
clients
to
ensure
they
make
the
right
strategic
decisions
for
their
business.
One
of
the
challenges
I
have
found
is
that
data
in
the
payments
space
is
often
piecemeal.
With
GD
all
of
the
data
I
need
is
in
one
place,
but
it
also
comes
with
additional
market
reports
that
provide
useful
extra
context
and
information.
Having
the
ability
to
set-up
alerts
on
relevant
movements
in
the
industry,
be
it
competitors
or
customers,
and
have
them
emailed
directly
to
me,
ensures
I
get
early
sight
of
industry
activity
and
don‚??t
have
to
search
for
news.

Canoo
Canoo
Inc.
is
an
American
automotive
company
based
in
Torrance,
California,
that
develops
and
manufactures
electric
vehicles.[2][3]
Canoo's
research
&
development
team
is
based
in
Michigan,
in
the
Detroit
region
(Auburn
Hills,
Livonia),
and
production
operations
are
in
Justin,
Texas.
The
company
also
plans
to
produce
commercial
electric
vehicles
such
as
vans
for
fleet,
vehicle
rental
and
ride
sharing
services.[4]
History[edit]
Canoo
was
founded
in
2017
under
the
name
Evelozcity
by
Stefan
Krause
and
Ulrich
Kranz.
Krause
worked
for
Deutsche
Bank
as
its
chief
financial
officer
while
Kranz
worked
for
BMW
as
a
senior
executive.
Both
men
met
at
rival
EV
company
Faraday
Future
before
leaving
together
to
form
their
own
company
in
2017,
due
to
disagreement
with
Faraday
Future's
leadership.
Krause
took
on
the
role
of
chief
executive
officer
at
Evelozcity,
and
Kranz
became
chief
technology
officer.[5]
The
company
received
its
primary
funding
from
Chinese
investor
Li
""David""
Pak-Tam/Botan
and
German
entrepreneur
David
Stern.[6][7]
In
April
2018,
Evelozcity
Canoo
hired
Karl-Thomas
Neumann,
the
former
head
of
Opel
as
a
senior
executive.[8]
In
March
2019
Evelozcity
was
renamed
Canoo.[9]
In
July
2019,
Neumann
left
Canoo,
but
he
remained
an
investor
in
the
company.[10]
In
September
2019,
the
company
presented
its
first
vehicle
prototype,
the
electric
van
Canoo,
which
was
later
renamed
to
the
Canoo
Lifestyle
Vehicle.[11]
In
February
2020,
Hyundai
Motor
Group,
the
parent
company
of
Hyundai
Motors
and
Kia
Motors,
announced
that
the
company
would
partner
with
Canoo
on
the
joint
development
of
a
new
electric
vehicle
platform.
The
platform
would
be
used
for
compact
vehicles
and
for
fleet
vehicles
such
as
shuttles.
The
deal
is
part
of
Hyundai's
Strategy
2025
program
which
will
see
Hyundai
investing
US$87¬†billion
for
five
years
starting
in
2020.[12][13][14]
In
July
2020,
co-founder
Stefan
Krause
left
the
company.
He
had
previously
taken
an
extended
leave
of
absence
in
August
2019
for
family
reasons.
Co-founder
Ulrich
Kranz
assumed
the
role
of
permanent
CEO
upon
Krause's
departure.[15][16]
In
July
2020,
Canoo
featured
on
the
TV
program
Jay
Leno's
Garage.[17]
In
September
2020,
Canoo
announced
a
merger
with
the
special-purpose
acquisition
company
Hennessy
Capital
Acquisition
Corp.
IV.,
intending
to
list
Canoo
on
the
NASDAQ
valued
at
$2.4¬†billion.[18]
The
expectation
was
to
raise
$300¬†million
to
help
finance
the
production
of
the
Canoo
minivan,
planned
for
launch
in
2022.[19][20]
On
December
22,
2020,
Canoo
completed
its
merger
with
Hennessy
Capital
Acquisition
Corp
IV.[21]
A
few
days
before
its
stock
exchange
debut,
the
company
announced
its
MPDV
(Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicle)
product
line.
The
entry
level
van
was
expected
to
sell
for
$33,000
on
arrival
in
limited
quantities
in
2022,
ramping
up
to
volume
production
in
2023.[22]
In
mid-January
2021,
The
Verge
reported
that
in
the
first
half
of
2020
Canoo
had
been
in
talks
with
Apple
for
a
potential
role
in
its
secretive
Titan
car
project.[23][24]
In
May
2022,
it
was
reported
that
Canoo
was
struggling
to
find
funding,
the
company
saying
that
it
had
only
enough
funding
to
operate
for
one
more
quarter.[25]
It
was
also
revealed
around
the
same
time
that
Canoo
was
suing
investor
Pak
Tim
Li,
claiming
they
were
selling
shares
improperly.[26]
In
December
2022,
the
company
sued
several
former
executives
of
stealing
Canoo's
trade
secrets
and
poaching
talent
for
their
new
business,[27][28]
competing
EV
startup
Harbinger
Motors.[29]
Corporate
changes[edit]
On
March
11,
2021,
Canoo
announced
the
Canoo
Pickup
Truck,
an
electric
pickup
set
to
release
in
2023.[30][31]
Canoo
announced
plans
to
offer
both
single-motor
and
dual-motor
all-wheel
drive
options
for
their
pickup
truck,
with
the
latter
being
capable
of
producing
600¬†hp
(450¬†kW)
and
550
foot-pounds
(750¬†J)
of
torque.[30]
The
company
said
that
the
truck
would
have
over
200
miles
(320¬†km)
of
range
and
a
1,800¬†lb
(820¬†kg)
payload
capacity.[30]
After
the
announcement,
shares
of
the
company
rose
by
14%.[31]
It
was
announced
in
March
2021
that
Canoo
had
terminated
its
partnership
with
Hyundai
Motor
Group
due
to
a
change
in
corporate
strategy.
The
company
also
announced
that
it
would
shift
away
from
vehicle
subscriptions
to
selling
commercial
vehicles.[32]
On
April
22,
2021,
the
company
announced
that
co-founder
and
CEO
Ulrich
Kranz
was
stepping
down
and
would
be
replaced
by
chairman
Tony
Aquila
as
CEO.[33]
Also
in
April
2021,
the
U.S.
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
launched
an
investigation
into
Canoo
after
its
merger
with
Hennessy
Capital
Acquisition
Corp.
IV
due
to
a
string
of
executive
departures,
sudden
changes
to
its
business
model,
and
class-action
lawsuits
brought
by
shareholders.[34]
On
June
17,
2021,
the
company
announced
they
would
build
a
new
factory
in
Pryor,
Oklahoma
(just
outside
Tulsa)
to
manufacture
all
of
their
future
vehicles.[35][36]
The
plant
will
be
used
to
build
""pod-shaped
vans
it
calls
'lifestyle
vehicles'
beginning
in
2023.""[36]
The
same
day,
Dutch
media
reported
that
the
Dutch
company
VDL
Nedcar
would
start
producing
Canoo
Minivans
for
the
European
market.[37]
Later
in
the
year,
Canoo
and
VDL
ended
the
manufacturing
agreement.[38]
On
November
15,
2021,
the
company
announced
it
would
move
its
headquarters
to
Bentonville,
Arkansas
and
establish
a
manufacturing
plant
there.[39]
As
of
December¬†2022[update]
the
company
still
lists
Torrance,
California
as
its
headquarters.[1][40]
In
January
2022,
Canoo
entered
into
a
10-year
US$17.7¬†million
lease
for
a
building
in
Bentonville,
Arkansas
for
an
""advanced
industrialization
facility""
to
be
used
for
low-volume
manufacturing.[41]
In
August
2022,
Canoo
disclosed
they
had
contracted
with
a
third
party
for
their
initial
vehicle
production.
Following
receipt
of
orders
in
October
2022,
Canoo
announced
plans
for
construction
of
a
vehicle
battery
production
facility
at
the
MidAmerica
Industrial
Park
(MAIP)
in
Pryor,
Oklahoma.[42]
This
was
in
addition
to
its
earlier
announcement
of
plans
for
a
vehicle
production
plant
at
MAIP
capable
of
producing
300,000
vehicles
per
year.[43]
In
late
November
2022,
Canoo
announced
an
agreement
to
purchase
of
an
existing
630,000
square
foot
plant
in
Oklahoma
City
to
start
vehicle
production
by
2023,
prior
to
completion
of
its
micro
megafactory
in
Pryor.[44]
In
April
2023,
the
company
announced
that
battery
production
would
proceed
at
Pryor
to
fulfill
a
United
States
Department
of
Defense
contract;
and,
while
vehicle
manufacturing
was
to
start
in
Oklahoma
City
before
the
end
of
2023,
long
range
plans
still
included
vehicle
assembly
at
Pryor
because
the
OKC
facility
would
not
meet
full
production
needs.[45]
The
Oklahoma
City
plant
transaction
was
completed
on
April
7,
2023;
the
plant
was
formerly
owned
and
operated
by
Terex.[46]
Firm
orders[edit]
On
April
13,
2022,
NASA
selected
Canoo
to
supply
crew
transportation
vehicles
for
its
Artemis
program,
with
a
total
contract
value
of
$147,855.[47][48]
In
July
2022,
Walmart
entered
into
a
definitive
agreement
to
purchase
4,500
all-electric
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicles
(LDV)
from
Canoo,
with
an
option
to
buy
up
to
10,000
in
the
future.[49]
Under
the
terms,
Walmart
can
terminate
the
agreement
for
convenience
upon
30
days
notice.[50]
Canoo
announced
two
major
orders
in
mid-October
2022.
Zeeba,
a
relatively
unknown
fleet
leasing
operation,
also
based
in
Greater
Los
Angeles,
ordered
a
combination
of
5,450
LDVs
and
Lifestyle
Vehicles
(LV),
with
a
binding
commitment
of
3,000
by
2024.[51][52][53]
Some
days
later,
Canoo
announced
its
biggest
sale
to
date,
an
order
from
Kingbee,
a
Utah-based
work-ready
van
fleet
rental
company.
In
addition
to
the
binding
order
of
9,300
LDVs,
Kingbee
has
the
option
to
double
the
order.[54][55]
Kingbee
outfits
its
vans
for
fleet
customers
in
construction
trades
(electrical,
plumbing,
energy),
delivery,
and
mobile
health.[56]
In
January
2024,
Canoo
announced
the
Postal
Service
(USPS)
order
for
six
right-hand-drive
LDV
vans.[57][58][59]

legal
conditions;
Canoo's
ability
to
access
future
capital,

prove
incorrect,

Canoo
anticipates

Struggling
Stocks
to
Sell
Before
They
Drag
You
Down
Let‚??s
face
reality
‚??
the
very
concept
of
struggling
stocks
to
sell
is
an
ugly
one.
In
many
ways,
the
loyalty
to
the
enterprises
in
our
portfolio
is
understandable.
It‚??s
not
just
about
the
money
put
in,
though
that
obviously
plays
the
biggest
factor.
Rather,
cutting
shares
out
is
akin
to
abandoning
your
favorite
sports
teams
because
they
had
a
rough
season.
As
Americans,
we
appreciate
the
dedication
that
fans
have
for
their
teams.

and
Hennessy

Acquisition
Corp.

(‚??HCAC‚?ù)
(NASDAQ:
HCAC),
a
special

acquisition
company,
today
announced
they
have
entered
into
a
definitive
agreement
for
a
business
combination
that
would
result
in
Canoo
becoming
a
publicly
listed
company.
Upon
closing
of
the
transaction,
the
combined
operating
company
will
be
named
Canoo
Inc.
and
will
continue
to
be
listed
on
the
Nasdaq
Stock
Market
under
the
ticker
symbol
‚??CNOO.‚?ù
Canoo
is
a
high-growth
EV
company,
distinguished
by
its
experienced
team
with
an
emphasis
on
engineering
expertise
and
achievement.
Canoo
has
designed
the
world‚??s
flattest
modular
‚??skateboard‚?ù
platform
that
allows
it
to
reimagine
EV
design,
maximize
usable
interior
space
and
support
a
wide
range
of
vehicle
applications.
Canoo‚??s
skateboard
architecture
‚??
a
unique,
self-contained,
independently
drivable
rolling
chassis
‚??
directly
houses
all
of
the
most
critical
components
of
an
EV.
It
will
feature
the
market‚??s
first
true
steer-by-wire
platform,
which,
along
with
a
composite
leaf
spring
suspension,
enables
the
skateboard‚??s
flat
structure
and
maximizes
vehicle
interior
space.
Canoo
has
also
developed
proprietary
electric
drivetrain
and
battery
systems
which
are
incorporated
into
the
skateboard.
All
of
Canoo‚??s
EVs
will
share
the
same
skateboard
and
utilize
different
cabins
or
‚??top
hats‚?ù
that
can
be
paired
on
top
to
create
unique
vehicles.
This
highly
modular
approach
will
facilitate
efficient
production
at
scale
and
enable
Canoo
to
rapidly
develop
vehicles
serving
different
market
and
consumer
segments
at
reduced
cost,
as
the
majority
of
research
and
development
and
crash
testing
is
built
into
the
skateboard.
Canoo
Co-Founder
and
Chief
Executive
Officer,
Ulrich
Kranz
said,
‚??Today
marks
an
important
milestone
of
Canoo‚??s
effort
to
reinvent
the
development,
production
and
go-to-market
model
of
the
electric
vehicle
industry.
Our
technology
allows
for
rapid
and
cost-effective
vehicle
development
through
the
world‚??s
flattest
skateboard
architecture,
and
we
believe
our
subscription
model
will
transform
the
consumer
ownership
experience.
We
are
excited
to
partner
with
Hennessy
Capital
and
we
are
energized
to
begin
our
journey
through
a
shared
passion
to
deliver
an
environmentally
friendly
and
versatile
vehicle
development
platform
to
the
market.‚?ù
Daniel
Hennessy,
Chairman
&
Chief
Executive
Officer
of
HCAC
said,
‚??We
are
thrilled
to
partner
with
Canoo
on
their
mission
to
reinvent
urban
mobility
with
a
greener,
simpler
and
more
affordable
portfolio
of
EV
solutions.
Unlike
any
other
EV
company,
Canoo
has
created
a
go-to-market
strategy
that
captures
both
B2C
and
B2B
demand
with
the
same
skateboard
architecture
and
technology
that
has
already
been
validated
by
key
partnerships
such
as
with
Hyundai.
HCAC
has
an
abiding
commitment
to
sustainable
technologies
and
infrastructure,
and
we
are
excited
to
serve
as
a
catalyst
to
advance
the
launch
of
the
Canoo
vehicle
offerings.‚?ù
Led
by
Kranz,
an
automotive
industry
veteran
with
more
than
30
years
of
executive
experience
at
BMW,
together
with
nearly
300
employees,
the
Canoo
team
has
already
shown
its
ability
to
deliver
results
by
successfully
designing,
engineering
and
manufacturing
its
Beta
vehicle
in
just
19
months
and
has
completed
more
than
50
physical
crash
tests.
Canoo
expects
to
introduce
its
first
model
in
2022
that
will
be
targeted
at
consumers
in
major
urban
markets.
This
lifestyle
vehicle
‚??
eponymously
named
the
canoo
‚??
leverages
the
company‚??s
low
profile
skateboard
architecture
to
deliver
the
highest
volume
utilization
across
all
classes
of
competitor
vehicles
currently
on
the
market
and
has
been
purposefully
developed
for
a
subscription
business
model.
In
addition,
Canoo
has
designed
a
commercial
delivery
B2B
vehicle
with
expected
availability
in
2023
that
directly
capitalizes
on
Canoo‚??s
core
skateboard
technology.
Canoo‚??s
delivery
vehicle
competes
in
a
size
segment
that
other
competitors
are
currently
not
addressing
and
capitalizes
on
the
need
for
a
small,
city-
built,
last-mile
delivery
solution.
This
high-efficiency
platform
maximizes
cubic
cargo
volume
and
targets
the
fast
growing
last-mile
delivery
market.
Canoo‚??s
consumer
go-to-market
strategy
capitalizes
on
changing
consumer
preferences
to
deliver
a
month-to-month,
commitment-free,
subscription-based
business
model.
With
a
single
monthly
fee
and
no
upfront
payment,
Canoo
members
enjoy
the
benefits
of
an
all-inclusive
experience
that,
in
addition
to
your
own
canoo
vehicle,
includes
maintenance,
warranty,
registration
and
access
to
insurance
and
vehicle
charging.
This
go-to-market
model
is
designed
to
deliver
an
affordable
and
simplified
customer
experience
while
also
enhancing
lifetime
vehicle
revenue
and
margin
to
shareholders.

HCAC
and

anticipate
that
subsequent

change.
However,
while
HCAC

specifically
disclaim

The
longer
Canoo
stays
alive,
the
worse
it
will
be
for
everyone
who
competes
with
it.
What
happened
Tuesday's
looking
like
a
lousy
day
to
be
invested
in
electric
vehicle
(EV)
stocks,
as
shares
of
EV
manufacturer
Canoo
(GOEV
2.18%)
tumbled
after
the
company
reported
another
sizable
loss,
and
better-established
EV
start-ups
Rivian
Automotive
(RIVN
5.21%)
and
Lucid
Group
(LCID
5.22%)
follow
them
down.
As
of
10:30
a.m.
ET,
Canoo
stock
is
sinking
6%,
tied
with
Lucid's
6%
loss,
and
Rivian
stock
is
doing
only
a
little
bit
better
--
down
4.7%.
NASDAQ:
GOEV
Key
Data
Points
So
what
Canoo
crowed,
at
the
top
of
its
earnings
release,
that
it
has
finally
""entered
the
revenue
and
income
generation
phase""
of
its
business
as
contracts
with
the
U.S.
Department
of
Defense
and
NASA
begin
filtering
onto
the
top
line.
And
yet
as
of
today
there's
still
no
sign
of
them.
Instead,
Canoo
reported
zero
revenue
for
the
quarter
(just
like
last
year's
Q2).
On
the
plus
side,
while
the
company
didn't
actually
generate
any
income
either,
its
loss
for
Q2
2023
was
only
$0.14
per
share
--
better
than
analysts'
forecast
$0.19-per-share
loss.
Canoo
also
noted
that
it
ended
the
quarter
with
$5
million
in
cash
--
but
would
have
ended
with
$61.2
million
if
it
had
completed
some
stock
and
debt
sales,
accomplished
later,
within
the
quarter.
Now
what
The
problem
with
this
for
Canoo
is
that,
according
to
Canoo's
cash
flow
statement,
the
company
is
still
burning
through
cash
at
a
rate
well
in
excess
of
$80
million
per
quarter
--
and
if
that
keeps
happening,
then
I'm
afraid
even
$61.2
million
in
cash
isn't
going
to
cut
it,
and
this
company
is
going
to
have
to
sell
even
more
stock,
and
take
on
even
more
debt,
in
order
to
remain
afloat.
The
problem
with
this
for
Rivian
and
Lucid,
meanwhile,
is
that
Canoo
still
seems
to
be
able
to
access
financing
to
keep
itself
afloat.
And
that
means
that
Canoo
is
still
sticking
around
to
offer
electric
vehicles
to
shoppers
who
might
otherwise
be
buying
Rivians
and
Lucids.
And
that
could
be
a
real
problem
for
these
similarly
unprofitable
rival
EV
makers.
Just
last
week,
HotCars.com
ran
a
glowing
profile
of
Canoo's
new
electric
pickup
truck,
and
indeed,
its
entire
lineup
of
""affordable
electric
vehicles
for
regular
customers,""
that
contrasts
starkly
with
Lucid's
offering
of
an
$82,000
Air
luxury
electric
sedan,
for
example,
or
Rivian's
$80,000
electric
pickup
truck.
At
the
$39,950
list
price
that
HotCars
describes,
Canoo's
electric
lifestyle
vehicle
costs
literally
half
of
what
the
competition
is
charging,
and
Canoo's
new
electric
pickup
is
expected
to
be
similarly
affordable.
Sure,
you
could
point
out
that
Canoo's
truck
won't
be
out
for
another
couple
of
years,
while
Rivian
and
Lucid
are
selling
EVs
already
today,
but
if
Canoo
can
keep
itself
solvent
long
enough,
the
risk
is
that
buyers
will
decide
it's
still
worth
the
wait.
