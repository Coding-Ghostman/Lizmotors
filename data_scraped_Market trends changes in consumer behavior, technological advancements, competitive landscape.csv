is
posing
a
challenge
to
the
traditional
rigid
canoe
and
kayak
business.
More
mobility,
convenience,
and
storage
options
are
provided
by
them,
which
make
them
especially
desirable
for
leisure
and
urban
paddlers.
In
order
to
capitalize
on
this
trend,
manufacturers
are
producing
inflatable
kayaks
with
more
useful
features,
better
materials,
and
inventive
designs
that
are
appropriate
for
longer
trips
and
rougher
waters.
Tech-Infused
Experiences
Paddling
is
changing
as
a
result
of
technology.
Fish-finding,
navigation,
and
safety
are
all
improved
when
GPS,
sonar,
weather
monitoring,
and
even
underwater
cameras
are
integrated
into
kayaks
and
canoes.
Fit-minded
paddlers
and
data-driven
fans
are
also
catered
to
by
smart
paddles
including
fitness
monitoring
capabilities
and
stroke
analysis.
This
technologically
driven
movement
expands
the
market
and
takes
canoeing
beyond
simple
leisure.
Sustainability
Focus
and
Eco-Friendly
Material
The
market
for
canoes
and
kayaks
is
being
impacted
by
environmental
awareness.
Manufacturers
are
utilizing
recycled
materials,
implementing
sustainable
procedures,
and
investigating
bio-based
substitutes
for
conventional
polyethylene
or
fiberglass.
The
need
for
firms
with
strong
sustainability
pledges
is
being
driven
by
consumers'
rising
desire
for
eco-friendly
solutions,
such
as
wooden
kayaks
or
bamboo
paddles.
The
market
is
faced
with
both
possibilities
and
problems
as
a
result
of
this
trend,
which
calls
for
innovation
and
distinction
in
manufacturing
methods
and
materials.

Citing
a
report
produced
by
Beyond
Market
Insights,
FinancialNewsMedia.com
reported
this
week
that
growth
of
the
electric
vehicle
industry
and
EV
market
is
expected
to
accelerate
quickly
in
the
coming
decade.
The
global
EV
market,
which
was
worth
about
$178.5
billion
in
2021,
has
been
projected
to
grow
to
around
$1.1
trillion
by
2030
with
a
compound
annual
growth
rate
of
roughly
22.5%,
the
outlet
reported.
It
said
exceptional
growth
is
anticipated
in
both
the
private
and
commercial
sectors.
Canoo,
an
EV
company
with
a
stake
in
Oklahoma,
was
cited
as
a
market
player.
‚ÄúThe
commercial
fleets
segment
is
expected
to
grow
significantly
in
the
global
electric
vehicle
market
during
the
projection
period.
Rising
fuel
prices,
tight
environmental
restrictions
enforced
by
governments,
increased
usage
of
autonomous
delivery
vehicles,
and
increased
use
of
electric
buses
and
trucks
are
all
contributing
to
this
market‚Äôs
strong
rise,‚Äù
it
said.
‚ÄúThe
major
companies
in
the
electric
vehicle
market
have
moved
their
attention
to
product
production
and
are
launching
important
tactics
including
mergers,
acquisitions,
and
joint
ventures
with
domestic
and
major
players
to
expand
their
product
offerings
and
solidify
their
market
position
globally.‚Äù
Canoo
Inc.
recently
said
it
would
build
a
battery
manufacturing
facility
at
Pryor
to
complement
other
plans
for
building
vehicles
in
Oklahoma.
The
site
noted
that
Canoo
will
be
the
first
EV
company
to
produce
battery
modules
using
hydropower
from
the
Grand
River
Dam
Authority.
The
company‚Äôs
new
battery
manufacturing
facility
will
be
in
the
same
industrial
park
as
its
future
‚ÄúMegaMicro‚Äù
factory.

of
Oklahoma
and
achieved
a
key
hiring
milestone.
The
state
is
now
home
to
20%
of
Canoo‚Äôs
total
workforce.
As
Canoo
scales
manufacturing
to
make
additional
customer
deliveries
in
2024,
the
company
is
continuing
to
build
the
team
of
skilled
workers
at
both
its
Oklahoma
City
vehicle
manufacturing
facility
and
also
at
its
battery
module

increase
its

is
growing
its
team
across

scale
manufacturing
and
meet
customer
deliveries
of
18,000
committed
orders
representing
$750
million
in
revenue
over
multiple
years.
Oklahomans
make
up
over
90%
of
the
Canoo
team
in
Oklahoma,
and
military
veterans
and
Native
Americans
each
make
up
about
10%
of
Canoo‚Äôs
workforce
in
the
state.
‚ÄúWith
our
manufacturing
hub
established
in
Oklahoma,
we
are
able
to
build
our
team
by
bringing
onboard
the
dedicated
and
hard-working
people
of
Oklahoma
who
have
experience
in
manufacturing,‚Äù
said
Tony
Aquila,
Investor,
Executive
Chairman,
and
CEO
of
Canoo.
‚ÄúWe
are
creating
high-paying
jobs
and
building
a
world-class
manufacturing
team
that
will
play
a
critical
role
in
the

our
growth.‚Äù
Canoo‚Äôs

annual
wages
about
37%
above

prove
incorrect,
actual

There
may

Canoo
anticipates
that
subsequent

assessments
to
change.
However,

elect

point
in
the
future,
Canoo
specifically
disclaims

Below
is
a
sample
report
to
help
you
understand
the
structure
of
the
report
you
are
buying
GlobalData
provides
a
great
range
of
information
and
reports
on
various
sectors
that
is
highly
relevant,
timely,
easy
to
access
and
utilise.
The
reports
and
data
dashboards
help
engagement
with
clients;
they
provide
valuable
industry
and
market
insights
that
can
enrich
client
conversations
and
can
help
in
the
shaping
of
value
propositions.
Moreover,
using
GlobalData
products
has
helped
increase
my
knowledge
of
the
finance
sector,
the
players
within
it,
and
the
general
threats
and
opportunities.
I
find
the
consumer
surveys
that
are
carried
out
to
be
extremely
beneficial
and
not
something
I
have
seen
anywhere
else.
They
provided
an
insightful
view
of
why
and
which
consumers
take
(or
don‚Äôt)
particular
financial
products.
This
can
help
shape
conversations
with
clients
to
ensure
they
make
the
right
strategic
decisions
for
their
business.
One
of
the
challenges
I
have
found
is
that
data
in
the
payments
space
is
often
piecemeal.
With
GD
all
of
the
data
I
need
is
in
one
place,
but
it
also
comes
with
additional
market
reports
that
provide
useful
extra
context
and
information.
Having
the
ability
to
set-up
alerts
on
relevant
movements
in
the
industry,
be
it
competitors
or
customers,
and
have
them
emailed
directly
to
me,
ensures
I
get
early
sight
of
industry
activity
and
don‚Äôt
have
to
search
for
news.
‚ÄúThe
GlobalData
platform
is
our
go-to
tool
for
intelligence
services.
GlobalData
provides
an
easy
way
to
access
comprehensive
intelligence
data
around
multiple
sectors,
which
essentially
makes
it
a
one-for-all
intelligence
platform,
for
tendering
and
approaching
customers.
GlobalData
is
very
customer
orientated,
with
a
high
degree
of
personalised
services,
which
benefits
everyday
use.
The
highly
detailed
project
intelligence
and
forecast
reports
can
be
utilised
across
multiple
departments
and
workflow
scopes,
from
operational
to
strategic
level,
and
often
support
strategic
decisions.
GlobalData
Analytics
and
visualisation
solutions
has
contributed
positively
when
preparing
management
presentations
and
strategic
papers.‚Äù
‚ÄúCOVID-19
has
caused
significant
interference
to
our
business
and
the
COVID-19
intelligence
from
GlobalData
has
helped
us
reach
better
decisions
around
strategy.
These
two
highlights
have
helped
enormously
to
understand
the
projections
into
the
future
concerning
our
business
units,
we
also
utilise
the
project
database
to
source
new
projects
for
Liebherr-Werk
to
use
as
an
additional
source
to
pitch
for
new
business.‚Äù
Your
daily
news
has
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
and
keeps
me
up-to-date
with
what
is
happening
in
the
market,
I
like
that
you
almost
always
have
a
link
to
the
source
origin.
We
also
use
your
market
data
in
our
Strategic
Business
Process
to
support
our
business
decisions.
By
having
everything
in
one
place
on
the
Intelligence
Center
it
has
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
versus
looking
on
different
sources,
the
alert
function
also
helps
with
this.
Having
used
several
other
market
research
companies,
I
find
that
GlobalData
manages
to
provide
that
‚Äòdifficult-to-get‚Äô
market
data
that
others
can‚Äôt,
as
well
as
very
diverse
and
complete
consumer
surveys.
Our
experience
with
GlobalData
has
been
very
good,
from
the
platform
itself
to
the
people.
I
find
that
the
analysts
and
the
account
team
have
a
high
level
of
customer
focus
and
responsiveness
and
therefore
I
can
always
rely
on.
The
platform
is
more
holistic
than
other
providers.
It
is
convenient
and
almost
like
a
one
stop
shop.
The
pricing
suite
is
highly
competitive
and
value
for
our
organisation.
I
like
reports
that
inform
new
segments
such
as
the
analysis
on
generation
Z,
millennials,
the
impact
of
COVID
19
to
our
banking
customers
and
their
new
channel
habits.
Secondly
the
specialist
insight
on
affluent
sector
significantly
increases
our
understanding
about
this
group
of
customers.
The
combination
of
those
give
us
depth
and
breadth
of
the
evolving
market.
I‚Äôm
in
the
business
of
answering
and
helping
people
make
decisions
so
with
the
intelligence
center
I
can
do
that,
effectively
and
efficiently.
I
can
share
quickly
key
insights
that
answer
and
satisfy
our
country
stakeholders
by
giving
them
many
quality
studies
and
primary
research
about
competitive
landscape
beyond
the
outlook
of
our
bank.
It
helps
me
be
seen
as
an
advisory
partner
and
that
makes
a
big
difference.
A
big
benefit
of
our
subscription
is
that
no
one
holds
the
whole
data
and
because
it
allows
so
many
people,
so
many
different
parts
of
our
organisation
have
access,
it
enables
all
teams
to
have
the
same
level
of
knowledge
and
decision
support.
‚ÄúI
know
that
I
can
always
rely
on
Globaldata‚Äôs
work
when
I‚Äôm
searching

the
right

I
use
Globaldata
insights
to
understand
the
changing
market
&
consumer
landscape
and
help
create
better
taste
&
wellbeing
solutions
for
our
customers
in
food,
beverage
and
healthcare
industries.
Globaldata
has
the
right
data
and
the
reports
are
of
very
high
quality
compared
to
your
competitors.
Globaldata
not
only
has
overall
market
sizes
&
consumer
insights
on
food
&
beverages
but
also
provides
insights
at
the
ingredient
&
flavour
level.
That
is
key
for
B2B
companies
like
Givaudan.
This
way
we
understand
our
customers‚Äô
business
and
also
gain
insight
to
our
unique
industry‚Äù
GlobalData
provides
a
great
range
of
information
and
reports
on
various
sectors
that
is
highly
relevant,
timely,
easy
to
access
and
utilise.
The
reports
and
data
dashboards
help
engagement
with
clients;
they
provide
valuable
industry
and
market
insights
that
can
enrich
client
conversations
and
can
help
in
the
shaping
of
value
propositions.
Moreover,
using
GlobalData
products
has
helped
increase
my
knowledge
of
the
finance
sector,
the
players
within
it,
and
the
general
threats
and
opportunities.
I
find
the
consumer
surveys
that
are
carried
out
to
be
extremely
beneficial
and
not
something
I
have
seen
anywhere
else.
They
provided
an
insightful
view
of
why
and
which
consumers
take
(or
don‚Äôt)
particular
financial
products.
This
can
help
shape
conversations
with
clients
to
ensure
they
make
the
right
strategic
decisions
for
their
business.
One
of
the
challenges
I
have
found
is
that
data
in
the
payments
space
is
often
piecemeal.
With
GD
all
of
the
data
I
need
is
in
one
place,
but
it
also
comes
with
additional
market
reports
that
provide
useful
extra
context
and
information.
Having
the
ability
to
set-up
alerts
on
relevant
movements
in
the
industry,
be
it
competitors
or
customers,
and
have
them
emailed
directly
to
me,
ensures
I
get
early
sight
of
industry
activity
and
don‚Äôt
have
to
search
for

Canoo
Canoo
Inc.
is
an
American
automotive
company
based
in
Torrance,
California,
that
develops
and
manufactures
electric
vehicles.[2][3]
Canoo's
research
&
development
team
is
based
in
Michigan,
in
the
Detroit
region
(Auburn
Hills,
Livonia),
and
production
operations
are
in
Justin,
Texas.
The
company
also
plans
to
produce
commercial
electric
vehicles
such
as
vans
for
fleet,
vehicle
rental
and
ride
sharing
services.[4]
History[edit]
Canoo
was
founded
in
2017
under
the
name
Evelozcity
by
Stefan
Krause
and
Ulrich
Kranz.
Krause
worked
for
Deutsche
Bank
as
its
chief
financial
officer
while
Kranz
worked
for
BMW
as
a
senior
executive.
Both
men
met
at
rival
EV
company
Faraday
Future
before
leaving
together
to
form
their
own
company
in
2017,
due
to
disagreement
with
Faraday
Future's
leadership.
Krause
took
on
the
role
of
chief
executive
officer
at
Evelozcity,
and
Kranz
became
chief
technology
officer.[5]
The
company
received
its
primary
funding
from
Chinese
investor
Li
""David""
Pak-Tam/Botan
and
German
entrepreneur
David
Stern.[6][7]
In
April
2018,
Evelozcity
Canoo
hired
Karl-Thomas
Neumann,
the
former
head
of
Opel
as
a
senior
executive.[8]
In
March
2019
Evelozcity
was
renamed
Canoo.[9]
In
July
2019,
Neumann
left
Canoo,
but
he
remained
an
investor
in
the
company.[10]
In
September
2019,
the
company
presented
its
first
vehicle
prototype,
the
electric
van
Canoo,
which
was
later
renamed
to
the
Canoo
Lifestyle
Vehicle.[11]
In
February
2020,
Hyundai
Motor
Group,
the
parent
company
of
Hyundai
Motors
and
Kia
Motors,
announced
that
the
company
would
partner
with
Canoo
on
the
joint
development
of
a
new
electric
vehicle
platform.
The
platform
would
be
used
for
compact
vehicles
and
for
fleet
vehicles
such
as
shuttles.
The
deal
is
part
of
Hyundai's
Strategy
2025
program
which
will
see
Hyundai
investing
US$87¬†billion
for
five
years
starting
in
2020.[12][13][14]
In
July
2020,
co-founder
Stefan
Krause
left
the
company.
He
had
previously
taken
an
extended
leave
of
absence
in
August
2019
for
family
reasons.
Co-founder
Ulrich
Kranz
assumed
the
role
of
permanent
CEO
upon
Krause's
departure.[15][16]
In
July
2020,
Canoo
featured
on
the
TV
program
Jay
Leno's
Garage.[17]
In
September
2020,
Canoo
announced
a
merger
with
the
special-purpose
acquisition
company
Hennessy
Capital
Acquisition
Corp.
IV.,
intending
to
list
Canoo
on
the
NASDAQ
valued
at
$2.4¬†billion.[18]
The
expectation
was
to
raise
$300¬†million
to
help
finance
the
production
of
the
Canoo
minivan,
planned
for
launch
in
2022.[19][20]
On
December
22,
2020,
Canoo
completed
its
merger
with
Hennessy
Capital
Acquisition
Corp
IV.[21]
A
few
days
before
its
stock
exchange
debut,
the
company
announced
its
MPDV
(Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicle)
product
line.
The
entry
level
van
was
expected
to
sell
for
$33,000
on
arrival
in
limited
quantities
in
2022,
ramping
up
to
volume
production
in
2023.[22]
In
mid-January
2021,
The
Verge
reported
that
in
the
first
half
of
2020
Canoo
had
been
in
talks
with
Apple
for
a
potential
role
in
its
secretive
Titan
car
project.[23][24]
In
May
2022,
it
was
reported
that
Canoo
was
struggling
to
find
funding,
the
company
saying
that
it
had
only
enough
funding
to
operate
for
one
more
quarter.[25]
It
was
also
revealed
around
the
same
time
that
Canoo
was
suing
investor
Pak
Tim
Li,
claiming
they
were
selling
shares
improperly.[26]
In
December
2022,
the
company
sued
several
former
executives
of
stealing
Canoo's
trade
secrets
and
poaching
talent
for
their
new
business,[27][28]
competing
EV
startup
Harbinger
Motors.[29]
Corporate
changes[edit]
On
March
11,
2021,
Canoo
announced
the
Canoo
Pickup
Truck,
an
electric
pickup
set
to
release
in
2023.[30][31]
Canoo
announced
plans
to
offer
both
single-motor
and
dual-motor
all-wheel
drive
options
for
their
pickup
truck,
with
the
latter
being
capable
of
producing
600¬†hp
(450¬†kW)
and
550
foot-pounds
(750¬†J)
of
torque.[30]
The
company
said
that
the
truck
would
have
over
200
miles
(320¬†km)
of
range
and
a
1,800¬†lb
(820¬†kg)
payload
capacity.[30]
After
the
announcement,
shares
of
the
company
rose
by
14%.[31]
It
was
announced
in
March
2021
that
Canoo
had
terminated
its
partnership
with
Hyundai
Motor
Group
due
to
a
change
in
corporate
strategy.
The
company
also
announced
that
it
would
shift
away
from
vehicle
subscriptions
to
selling
commercial
vehicles.[32]
On
April
22,
2021,
the
company
announced
that
co-founder
and
CEO
Ulrich
Kranz
was
stepping
down
and
would
be
replaced
by
chairman
Tony
Aquila
as
CEO.[33]
Also
in
April
2021,
the
U.S.
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
launched
an
investigation
into
Canoo
after
its
merger
with
Hennessy
Capital
Acquisition
Corp.
IV
due
to
a
string
of
executive
departures,
sudden
changes
to
its
business
model,
and
class-action
lawsuits
brought
by
shareholders.[34]
On
June
17,
2021,
the
company
announced
they
would
build
a
new
factory
in
Pryor,
Oklahoma
(just
outside
Tulsa)
to
manufacture
all
of
their
future
vehicles.[35][36]
The
plant
will
be
used
to
build
""pod-shaped
vans
it
calls
'lifestyle
vehicles'
beginning
in
2023.""[36]
The
same
day,
Dutch
media
reported
that
the
Dutch
company
VDL
Nedcar
would
start
producing
Canoo
Minivans
for
the
European
market.[37]
Later
in
the
year,
Canoo
and
VDL
ended
the
manufacturing
agreement.[38]
On
November
15,
2021,
the
company
announced
it
would
move
its
headquarters
to
Bentonville,
Arkansas
and
establish
a
manufacturing
plant
there.[39]
As
of
December¬†2022[update]
the
company
still
lists
Torrance,
California
as
its
headquarters.[1][40]
In
January
2022,
Canoo
entered
into
a
10-year
US$17.7¬†million
lease
for
a
building
in
Bentonville,
Arkansas
for
an
""advanced
industrialization
facility""
to
be
used
for
low-volume
manufacturing.[41]
In
August
2022,
Canoo
disclosed
they
had
contracted
with
a
third
party
for
their
initial
vehicle
production.
Following
receipt
of
orders
in
October
2022,
Canoo
announced
plans
for
construction
of
a
vehicle
battery
production
facility
at
the
MidAmerica
Industrial
Park
(MAIP)
in
Pryor,
Oklahoma.[42]
This
was
in
addition
to
its
earlier
announcement
of
plans
for
a
vehicle
production
plant
at
MAIP
capable
of
producing
300,000
vehicles
per
year.[43]
In
late
November
2022,
Canoo
announced
an
agreement
to
purchase
of
an
existing
630,000
square
foot
plant
in
Oklahoma
City
to
start
vehicle
production
by
2023,
prior
to
completion
of
its
micro
megafactory
in
Pryor.[44]
In
April
2023,
the
company
announced
that
battery
production
would
proceed
at
Pryor
to
fulfill
a
United
States
Department
of
Defense
contract;
and,
while
vehicle
manufacturing
was
to
start
in
Oklahoma
City
before
the
end
of
2023,
long
range
plans
still
included
vehicle
assembly
at
Pryor
because
the
OKC
facility
would
not
meet
full
production
needs.[45]
The
Oklahoma
City
plant
transaction
was
completed
on
April
7,
2023;
the
plant
was
formerly
owned
and
operated
by
Terex.[46]
Firm
orders[edit]
On
April
13,
2022,
NASA
selected
Canoo
to
supply
crew
transportation
vehicles
for
its
Artemis
program,
with
a
total
contract
value
of
$147,855.[47][48]
In
July
2022,
Walmart
entered
into
a
definitive
agreement
to
purchase
4,500
all-electric
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicles
(LDV)
from
Canoo,
with
an
option
to
buy
up
to
10,000
in
the
future.[49]
Under
the
terms,
Walmart
can
terminate
the
agreement
for
convenience
upon
30
days
notice.[50]
Canoo
announced
two
major
orders
in
mid-October
2022.
Zeeba,
a
relatively
unknown
fleet
leasing
operation,
also
based
in
Greater
Los
Angeles,
ordered
a
combination
of
5,450
LDVs
and
Lifestyle
Vehicles
(LV),
with
a
binding
commitment
of
3,000
by
2024.[51][52][53]
Some
days
later,
Canoo
announced
its
biggest
sale
to
date,
an
order
from
Kingbee,
a
Utah-based
work-ready
van
fleet
rental
company.
In
addition
to
the
binding
order
of
9,300
LDVs,
Kingbee
has
the
option
to
double
the
order.[54][55]
Kingbee
outfits
its
vans
for
fleet
customers
in
construction
trades
(electrical,
plumbing,
energy),
delivery,
and
mobile
health.[56]
In
January
2024,
Canoo
announced
the
Postal
Service
(USPS)
order
for
six
right-hand-drive
LDV
vans.[57][58][59]

Let‚Äôs

‚Äì
the

struggling

is
an
ugly
one.
In

ways,
the

understandable.
It‚Äôs
not
just
about
the

that

factor.
Rather,
cutting

out
is
akin
to
abandoning
your

because
they

a

season.
As
Americans,
we

the

Canoo
is
a
high-growth
EV
company,
distinguished
by
its
experienced
team
with
an
emphasis
on
engineering
expertise
and
achievement.
Canoo
has
designed
the
world‚Äôs
flattest
modular
‚Äúskateboard‚Äù
platform
that
allows
it
to
reimagine
EV
design,
maximize
usable
interior
space
and
support
a
wide
range
of
vehicle
applications.
Canoo‚Äôs
skateboard
architecture
‚Äì
a
unique,
self-contained,
independently
drivable
rolling
chassis
‚Äì
directly
houses
all
of
the
most
critical
components
of
an
EV.
It
will
feature
the
market‚Äôs
first
true
steer-by-wire
platform,
which,
along
with
a
composite
leaf
spring
suspension,
enables
the
skateboard‚Äôs
flat
structure
and
maximizes
vehicle
interior
space.
Canoo
has
also
developed
proprietary
electric
drivetrain
and
battery
systems
which
are
incorporated
into
the

All
of

skateboard
and
utilize
different
cabins
or
‚Äútop
hats‚Äù
that
can
be
paired
on
top
to
create
unique
vehicles.
This
highly
modular
approach
will
facilitate
efficient
production
at
scale
and
enable
Canoo
to
rapidly
develop
vehicles
serving
different
market
and
consumer
segments
at
reduced
cost,
as
the
majority
of
research
and
development
and
crash

is
built
into
the
skateboard.
Canoo
Co-Founder
and
Chief
Executive
Officer,
Ulrich
Kranz
said,
‚ÄúToday
marks
an
important
milestone
of
Canoo‚Äôs
effort
to
reinvent
the

Our

and
we
believe
our

We
are
excited

and
we

been
validated
by
key
partnerships
such
as
with
Hyundai.
HCAC
has
an
abiding
commitment
to
sustainable
technologies
and
infrastructure,
and
we
are
excited
to
serve
as
a
catalyst
to
advance
the
launch
of
the
Canoo
vehicle
offerings.‚Äù
Led
by
Kranz,
an
automotive
industry
veteran
with
more
than
30
years
of
executive
experience
at
BMW,
together
with
nearly
300
employees,
the
Canoo
team
has
already
shown
its
ability
to
deliver
results
by
successfully
designing,
engineering
and
manufacturing
its
Beta
vehicle
in
just
19
months
and
has
completed
more
than
50
physical
crash
tests.
Canoo
expects
to
introduce
its
first
model
in
2022
that
will
be
targeted
at
consumers
in
major
urban
markets.
This
lifestyle
vehicle
‚Äì
eponymously
named
the
canoo
‚Äì
leverages
the
company‚Äôs
low
profile
skateboard
architecture
to
deliver
the
highest
volume
utilization
across
all
classes
of
competitor
vehicles
currently
on
the
market
and
has
been
purposefully
developed
for
a
subscription
business
model.
In
addition,
Canoo
has
designed
a
commercial
delivery
B2B
vehicle
with
expected
availability
in
2023
that
directly
capitalizes
on
Canoo‚Äôs
core
skateboard
technology.
Canoo‚Äôs
delivery
vehicle
competes
in
a
size
segment
that
other
competitors
are
currently
not
addressing
and
capitalizes
on
the
need
for
a
small,
city-
built,
last-mile
delivery
solution.
This
high-efficiency
platform
maximizes
cubic
cargo
volume
and
targets
the
fast
growing
last-mile
delivery
market.
Canoo‚Äôs
consumer
go-to-market
strategy
capitalizes
on
changing
consumer
preferences
to
deliver
a
month-to-month,
commitment-free,
subscription-based
business
model.
With
a
single
monthly
fee
and
no
upfront
payment,
Canoo
members
enjoy
the
benefits
of
an
all-inclusive
experience
that,
in
addition
to
your
own
canoo
vehicle,
includes
maintenance,
warranty,
registration
and
access
to
insurance
and
vehicle
charging.
This
go-to-market
model
is
designed
to
deliver
an
affordable
and
simplified
customer
experience
while
also
enhancing
lifetime
vehicle
revenue
and
margin
to
shareholders.

better-established
EV
start-ups
Rivian
Automotive
(RIVN
5.21%)
and
Lucid
Group
(LCID
5.22%)
follow
them
down.
As
of
10:30
a.m.
ET,
Canoo
stock
is
sinking
6%,
tied
with
Lucid's
6%
loss,
and
Rivian
stock
is
doing
only
a
little
bit
better
--
down
4.7%.
NASDAQ:
GOEV
Key
Data
Points
So
what
Canoo
crowed,
at
the
top
of
its
earnings
release,
that
it
has
finally
""entered
the
revenue
and
income
generation
phase""
of
its
business
as
contracts
with
the
U.S.
Department
of
Defense
and
NASA
begin
filtering
onto
the
top
line.
And
yet
as
of
today
there's
still
no
sign
of
them.
Instead,
Canoo
reported
zero
revenue
for
the
quarter
(just
like
last
year's
Q2).
On
the
plus
side,
while
the
company
didn't
actually
generate
any
income
either,
its
loss
for
Q2
2023
was
only
$0.14
per
share
--
better
than
analysts'
forecast
$0.19-per-share
loss.
Canoo
also
noted
that
it
ended
the
quarter
with
$5
million
in
cash
--
but
would
have
ended
with
$61.2
million
if
it
had
completed
some
stock
and
debt
sales,
accomplished
later,
within
the
quarter.
Now
what
The
problem
with
this
for
Canoo
is
that,
according
to
Canoo's
cash
flow
statement,
the
company
is
still
burning
through
cash
at
a
rate
well
in
excess
of
$80
million
per
quarter
--
and
if
that
keeps
happening,
then
I'm
afraid
even
$61.2
million
in
cash
isn't
going
to
cut
it,
and
this
company
is
going
to
have
to
sell
even
more
stock,
and
take
on
even
more
debt,
in
order
to
remain
afloat.
The
problem
with
this
for
Rivian
and
Lucid,
meanwhile,
is
that
Canoo
still
seems
to
be
able
to
access
financing
to
keep
itself
afloat.
And
that
means
that
Canoo
is
still
sticking
around
to
offer
electric
vehicles
to
shoppers
who
might
otherwise
be
buying
Rivians
and
Lucids.
And
that
could
be
a
real
problem
for
these
similarly
unprofitable
rival
EV
makers.
Just
last
week,
HotCars.com
ran
a
glowing
profile
of
Canoo's
new
electric
pickup
truck,
and
indeed,
its
entire
lineup
of
""affordable
electric
vehicles
for
regular
customers,""
that
contrasts
starkly
with
Lucid's
offering
of
an
$82,000
Air
luxury
electric
sedan,
for
example,
or
Rivian's
$80,000
electric
pickup
truck.
At
the
$39,950
list
price
that
HotCars
describes,
Canoo's
electric
lifestyle
vehicle
costs
literally
half
of
what
the
competition
is
charging,
and
Canoo's
new
electric
pickup
is
expected
to
be
similarly
affordable.
Sure,
you
could
point
out
that
Canoo's
truck
won't
be
out
for
another
couple
of
years,
while
Rivian
and
Lucid
are
selling
EVs
already
today,
but
if
Canoo
can
keep
itself
solvent
long
enough,
the
risk
is
that
buyers
will
decide
it's
still
worth
the
wait.

The
Evolution
of
Consumer
Behavior:
Marketing
Trends
to
Stay
Ahead
Attention
Grabbers
Dominate
LinkedIn
with
Our
Proven
Strategy
and
Expert
Marketing
Services.
In
today's
dynamic
marketplace,
understanding
consumer
behavior
is
crucial
for
businesses
to
stay
ahead
of
the
competition.
Consumer
behavior
has
undergone
significant
evolution,
influenced
by
various
factors
such
as
technology,
social
media,
and
changing
lifestyles.
In
this
blog
post,
we
will
explore
the
evolving
landscape
of
consumer
behavior
and
highlight
key
marketing
trends
that
can
help
businesses
adapt
and
thrive.
By
reading
this
article,
you
will
gain
valuable
insights
into
the
latest
consumer
behavior
trends,
practical
tips
to
engage
with
your
target
audience
effectively,
and
strategies
to
stay
ahead
in
the
ever-changing
marketing
landscape.
The
Evolution
of
Consumer
Behavior:
Consumer
behavior
has
transformed
over
time,
driven
by
technological
advancements
and
changing
societal
norms.
Today,
consumers
are
more
informed,
connected,
and
empowered.
They
have
access
to
vast
information,
opinions,
and
options,
shaping
their
decision-making
process.
Factors
such
as
increased
connectivity,
globalization,
and
e-commerce
have
contributed
to
this
evolution.
Essential
Marketing
Trends:
To
effectively
reach
and
engage
with
today's
consumers,
businesses
must
align
their
marketing
strategies
with
the
evolving
trends.
Here
are
three
key
marketing
trends
that
can
help
companies
to
stay
ahead:
Personalization
and
Customization:
Personalized
marketing
has
become
essential
for
capturing
consumer
attention
and
fostering
brand
loyalty.
Businesses
can
create
a
deeper
connection
with
their
target
audience
by
tailoring
messages,
offers,
and
experiences
to
individual
preferences.
From
personalized
emails
to
customized
product
recommendations,
companies
can
leverage
data
and
analytics
to
deliver
relevant
and
meaningful
interactions.
For
example,
clothing
retailers
can
use
data
from
customers'
previous
purchases
and
browsing
history
to
recommend
personalized
outfit
suggestions.
This
personalized
approach
makes
consumers
feel
valued
and
understood,
increasing
the
likelihood
of
conversion
and
repeat
purchases.
Influence
of
Social
Media
and
Online
Platforms:
Social
media
platforms
have
revolutionized
how
consumers
discover,
evaluate,
and
engage
with
brands.
Social
media
influences
consumer
behavior
by
providing
a
platform
for
sharing
experiences,
opinions,
and
recommendations.
Brands
that
effectively
leverage
social
media
can
build
brand
awareness,
credibility,
and
trust
among
their
target
audience.
In
addition
to
social
media,
online
platforms,
such
as
review
websites
and
influencers'
blogs,
play
a
significant
role
in
shaping
consumer
choices.
Consumers
actively
seek
out
reviews
and
recommendations
before
making
purchasing
decisions.
Businesses
need
to
monitor
and
engage
in
online
conversations
about
their
brand
to
maintain
a
positive
online
presence.
Rise
of
Mobile
and
Voice
Search:
With
the
proliferation
of
smartphones,
mobile
devices
have
become
an
integral
part
of
consumers'
lives.
Mobile
usage
has
changed
how
consumers
search
for
information,
purchase,
and
interact
with
brands.
Optimizing
websites
and
marketing
campaigns
for
mobile
devices
is
crucial
for
reaching
and
engaging
with
the
mobile-savvy
audience.
Furthermore,
the
emergence
of
voice
assistants
and
voice
search
has
further
transformed
consumer
behavior.
Voice
search
offers
convenience
and
speed,
allowing
consumers
to
perform
tasks
hands-free.
Businesses
need
to
optimize
their
online
presence
for
voice
search,
ensuring
their
content
is
easily
discoverable
through
voice-activated
devices.
Strategies
to
Stay
Ahead:
To
stay
ahead
in
the
evolving
landscape
of
consumer
behavior,
businesses
should
consider
the
following
strategies:
Adaptation
and
Flexibility:
Being
agile
and
adaptive
is
essential
in
responding
to
changing
consumer
behaviors.
Businesses
should
closely
monitor
market
trends,
consumer
preferences,
and
emerging
technologies.
By
quickly
identifying
shifts
in
consumer
behavior,
businesses
can
modify
their
marketing
strategies
and
tactics
to
stay
relevant
and
meet
evolving
consumer
needs.
Embracing
Technology
and
Data
Analytics:
Technology
and
data
analytics
provide
valuable
insights
into
consumer
behavior.
Businesses
should
embrace
emerging
technologies
and
leverage
data
analytics
tools
to
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
their
target
audience.
By
analyzing
consumer
data,
companies
can
identify
patterns,
preferences,
and
pain
points,
allowing
them
to
tailor
their
marketing
efforts
effectively.
Conclusion:
Understanding
the
evolution
of
consumer
behavior
is
crucial
for
businesses
aiming
to
stay
ahead
in
today's
competitive
marketplace.
Businesses
can
effectively
engage
and
connect
with
their
target
audience
by
adapting
to
the
changing
trends
and
leveraging
personalized
marketing,
social
media,
mobile
optimization,
and
data
analytics.
By
implementing
the
strategies
discussed
in
this
blog,
you
can
position
your
business
for
success
in
the
ever-evolving
consumer
landscape.
Stay
proactive,
embrace

and
continuously
monitor

behavior
to
maintain
a
competitive
edge
in
the
United
States
market.

two
important
concepts
that

differences
between
the
two,
businesses
can
develop
a
more
comprehensive
understanding
of
their

Challenges
of
Market
Research
and
Market
Trends
Data
Collection
One
of
the
critical
components
of
market
research
is
data
collection.
The
process
of
data
collection
involves
gathering
and
recording
information
that
is
relevant
to
the
research
question.
However,
collecting
accurate
and
relevant
data
poses
several
challenges
that
make
the

challenge
is
the
issue
of
the
representativeness
of
the
sample.
The
sample
selected

collection
process
and
skew
the
results.
Therefore,
it
is
critical
to
mitigate
researcher
bias
in
the
data
collection
process
through
training
and
awareness.
Lastly,
the
data
collected
must
be
accurate,
complete,
and
consistent.
Inaccurate
or
incomplete
data
can
lead
to
erroneous
conclusions
and
affect
the
reliability
of
the
findings.
Therefore,
it
is
crucial
to
have
rigorous
quality
control
mechanisms
in
place
to
ensure
that
the
data
collected
is
valid,
reliable,
and
accurate.
In
conclusion,
data
collection
is
a
critical
component
of
market
research
that
is
fundamental
to
the
success
of
any
project.
The
challenges
related
to
collecting
accurate
and
relevant
data
are
numerous
and
require
rigorous
attention
to
detail.
Overcoming
these
challenges
is
vital
to
ensure
that
the
data
collected
is
valid,
reliable,
and
accurate,
allowing
for
accurate
and
informed
decision-making.
Data
Analysis
The
process
of
analyzing
and
interpreting
data
collected
during
market
research
is
fundamental
to
obtaining
insights
into
market
trends
and
consumer
behavior.
During
data
analysis,
researchers
are
faced
with
various
challenges
that
can
affect
the
accuracy
and
relevance
of
their
findings.
One
such
challenge
is
the
need
to
ensure

analyzed
represents
the
target
population
accurately.
This
is
particularly
critical
when
dealing
with
large
datasets
that
require
careful

may
lead
to
misinterpretation
of
data
and
affect
the
outcomes
of
the
research.
Another
challenge
related
to
data
analysis
is
ensuring
data
quality.
Data
quality
issues
can
arise
from
factors
such
as
data
collection
methods,
storage,
and
processing.
Incorrectly
recorded
or
misinterpreted
data
can
lead
to
incorrect
conclusions
and
affect
the
overall
credibility
of

crucial
part
of
the
market
research
process.
If
not
done
properly,
it
can
affect
the
accuracy

data
quality,
ensuring
that
the
analyzed
data
represents
the
target
population,
and
use
appropriate
analytical
tools
and
techniques.
By
addressing
these
challenges,
researchers
can
obtain
actionable
insights
into
market
trends
and
consumer
behavior,
thus
providing

Future
Outlook
The

trend
that
we
can
expect
to
see
is
an
increased
focus
on
personalized
marketing.
As
consumers
become
more
empowered
and
demanding,
businesses
will
need
to
find
new
and
innovative
ways
to
engage
with
them
on
an
individual
level.
This
will
require
a
deeper

transformed
the
way
consumers
interact
with
FMCG
products.
From
researching
product
reviews
to
comparing
prices,
consumers
now
have
the
convenience
of
making
informed
purchase
decisions
online.
This
shift
has
compelled
FMCG
companies
to
establish
a
strong
online
presence
and
optimize
their
digital
marketing
strategies.
Social
Media
Influence:
Powerfully
Engaging
and
Shaping
Consumer
Behavior
Social
media
platforms
have
become
powerful
tools
for
influencing
consumer
behavior
in
the
FMCG
industry.
Through
targeted
ads,
engaging
content,
and
influencer
marketing,
companies
can
directly
connect
with
their
target
audience
and
build
brand
loyalty.
Social
media
platforms
also
provide
valuable
insights
into
consumer
preferences,
allowing
companies
to
refine
their
strategies
further.
Data
and
Analytics:
Leveraging
Consumer
Insights
for
Personalization
Data
and
analytics
play
a
pivotal
role
in
understanding
consumer
behavior
and
tailoring
products
and
marketing
strategies
to
individual
preferences.
FMCG
companies
can
leverage
data
to
gain
insights
into
consumer
trends,
preferences,
and
shopping
habits.
This
data-driven
approach
enables
companies
to
offer
personalized
experiences
that
resonate
with
consumers
on
a
deeper
level.
Health
Consciousness:
Shift
towards
Healthier
FMCG
Products
Consumers
are
increasingly
prioritizing
health
and
wellness,
leading
to
a
shift
in
FMCG
product
preferences.
Health-conscious
consumers
seek
out
products
with
natural
ingredients,
reduced
sugar
content,
or
specific
dietary
benefits.
FMCG
companies
are
responding
by
developing
healthier
alternatives
to
meet
this
growing
demand.
Sustainability
and
Ethical
Consumerism:
Impact
on
FMCG
Choices
The
rise
of
sustainability
and
ethical
consumerism
has
also
had
a
significant
impact
on
FMCG
choices.
Consumers
are
increasingly
concerned
about
the
environmental
and
social
impact
of
the
products
they
purchase.
They
seek
out
eco-friendly
packaging,
ethical
sourcing,
and
cruelty-free
practices.
FMCG
companies
are
embracing
sustainability
initiatives
to
cater
to
these
conscious
consumers.
Plant-Based
and
Alternative
Products:
Catering
to
Changing
Dietary
Preferences
Changing
dietary
preferences,
such
as
the
rise
of
plant-based
diets,
have
influenced
consumer
behavior
in
the
FMCG
industry.
As
more
people
opt
for
vegetarian
or
vegan
lifestyles,
there
is
a
growing
demand
for
plant-based
alternatives
to
traditional
FMCG
products.
Companies
now
offer
plant-based
meats,
dairy-free
options,
and
substitutes
for
various
food
and
beverage
categories
to
meet
these
evolving
preferences.
With
consumer
behavior
constantly
evolving,
FMCG
companies
must
stay
attuned
to
the
changing
landscape,
embrace
innovation,
and
prioritize
the
values
and
preferences
of
their
target
audience.
By
understanding
and
adapting
to
these
shifts,
companies
can
successfully
navigate
the
ever-changing
consumer
behaviour
in
the
FMCG
industry.
How
E-commerce
is
Changing
Consumer
Purchase
Behavior
Gone
are
the
days
of
rushing
to
the
supermarket
after
work
or
braving
the
crowds
on
the
weekend
for
FMCG
products.
With
the
rise
of
e-commerce,
consumers
can
now
conveniently
browse
and
purchase
their
favorite
FMCG
brands
from
the
comfort
of
their
homes
or
on-the-go.
This
increased
accessibility
has
revolutionized
consumer
behaviour,
as
people
no
longer
need
to
be
tied
to
physical
stores
to
fulfil
their
daily
needs.
User
Reviews
and
Ratings:
Shaping
Consumer
Trust
and
Product
Selection
When
it
comes
to
purchasing
FMCG
products
online,
one
thing
consumers
heavily
rely
on
is
user
reviews
and
ratings.
This
feedback
from
fellow
shoppers
acts
as
a
guiding
compass,
helping
consumers
make
informed
decisions
about
the
quality
and
effectiveness
of
the
products
they
are
considering.
Positive
reviews
and
high
ratings
boost
consumer
trust
and
confidence,
while
negative
feedback
can
discourage
potential
buyers.
Demand
for
Subscription
Services:
New
Models
for
FMCG
Purchases
Subscription
services
have
become
increasingly
popular
in
the
FMCG
industry,
allowing
consumers
to
receive
regular
shipments
of
their
favorite
products
without
the
hassle
of
reordering
every
time.
From
meal
kits
to
beauty
boxes,
subscription
services
offer
convenience
and
surprise,
creating
a
sense
of
anticipation
and
delight
for
consumers.
This
new
purchasing
model
has
influenced
consumer
behavior
by
shifting
the
focus
from
one-time
purchases
to
long-term
commitments,
fostering
loyalty
and
regular
engagement
with
brands.
Brand
Loyalty
vs.
Product
Experience:
Balancing
Consumer
Expectations
Brand
loyalty
plays
a
significant
role
in
consumer
behavior
within
the
FMCG
industry.
Established
brands
often
have
a
strong
following
of
loyal
customers
who
trust
their
products
and
continuously
choose
them
over
competitors.
These
customers
are
willing
to
pay
a
premium
for
the
perceived
reliability
and
familiarity
that
comes
with
well-known
brands.
However,
brand
loyalty
alone
is
not
enough
to
sustain
consumer
interest
in
the
long
term.

Product
Experience
and
Quality:
Factors
Influencing
Consumer
Preferences
While
brand
loyalty
can
attract
consumers,
the
product
experience
and
quality
are
equally
essential
in
shaping
consumer
preferences.
FMCG
consumers
value
products
that
not
only
meet
their
needs
but
also
deliver
an
exceptional
experience.
From
taste
and
texture
to
packaging
and
functionality,
these
factors
heavily
influence
consumer
purchasing
decisions.
Brands
need
to
constantly
innovate
and
improve
their
products
to
meet
changing
consumer
expectations.
The
Role
of
Packaging
and
Marketing:
Creating
a
Positive
Consumer
Perception
In
a
crowded
market,
packaging
and
marketing
play
a
crucial
role
in
capturing
consumer
attention
and
creating
a
positive
perception
of
FMCG
products.
Eye-catching
designs,
clear
messaging,
and
effective
branding
can
make
a
significant
difference
in
influencing
consumer
behavior.
Brands
that
invest
in
packaging
innovation
and
engaging
marketing
campaigns
have
a
higher
chance
of
standing
out
and
attracting
consumers
in
an
increasingly
competitive
landscape.
Personalization
and
Customization:
Tailoring
Marketing
to
Individual
Consumer
Preferences
Personalization
has
become
a
key
aspect
of
effective
marketing
strategies
in
the
FMCG
industry.
By
leveraging
consumer
data
and
insights,
brands
can
tailor
their
marketing
efforts
to
meet
individual
preferences
and
needs.
Whether
it's
personalized
recommendations,
exclusive
offers,
or
targeted
advertising,
brands
that
make
consumers
feel
seen
and
understood
have
a
higher
chance
of
capturing
their
attention
and
loyalty.
Influencer
Marketing:
Leveraging
Social
Media
Influencers
for
FMCG
Brands
The
rise
of
social
media
has
given
birth
to
a
new
form
of
marketing:
influencer
marketing.
FMCG
brands
are
increasingly
partnering
with
popular
social
media
influencers
who
align
with
their
target
audience
to
promote
their
products.
These
influencers
can
sway
consumer
opinions
and
behaviours
through
their
authentic
and
relatable
content.
By
leveraging
influencers'
influence,
FMCG
brands
can
effectively
reach
their
target
market
and
build
brand
awareness.
Storytelling
and
Authenticity:
Connecting
with
Consumers
on
a
Deeper
Level
In
today's
cluttered
advertising
landscape,
consumers
crave
authenticity
and
storytelling.
Brands
that
can
connect
with
consumers
on
a
deeper
level,
by
sharing
their
values,
mission,
and
purpose
through
compelling
storytelling,
can
create
a
strong
emotional
connection.
By
tapping
into
consumers'
emotions,
brands
can
foster
loyalty
and
advocacy,
influencing
consumer
behavior
and
their
decision
to
choose
their
products
over
competitors.
Corporate
Social
Responsibility:
Building
Trust
and
Loyalty
Through
Social
Initiatives
Corporate
social
responsibility
(CSR)
initiatives
have
become
an
important
aspect
of
consumer
behavior
in
the
FMCG
industry.
Consumers
value
brands
that
actively
contribute
to
society
and
make
a
positive
impact
beyond
their
products.
From
supporting
social
causes
to
implementing
fair
labor
practices,
brands
that
prioritize
CSR
initiatives
can
build
trust
and
loyalty
among
consumers
who
want
to
align
themselves
with
socially
responsible
companies.
Transparency
and
Authenticity:
The
Demand
for
Honest
Communication
and
Product
Information
In
an
era
of
information
overload,
consumers
expect
transparency
and
authenticity
from
FMCG
brands.
They
want
to
know
what
ingredients
are
used,
where
products
are
made,
and
how
they
are
produced.
Brands
that
provide
clear
and
honest
communication
about
their
products,
including
any
potential
drawbacks
or
limitations,
are
more
likely
to
build
trust
with
consumers.
Openness
and
transparency
are
crucial
in
shaping
consumer
behavior
and
fostering
long-term
brand-consumer
relationships.
In
conclusion,
the
FMCG
industry
is
witnessing
a
dynamic
shift
in
consumer
behavior,
driven
by
technological
advancements,
changing
preferences,
and
the
rise
of
e-commerce.
To
thrive
in
this
changing
landscape,
businesses
must
stay
abreast
of
these
trends
and
adapt
their
strategies
accordingly.
By
embracing
digital
transformation,
prioritizing
health
and
sustainability,
optimizing
e-commerce
channels,
and
delivering
exceptional
product
experiences,
FMCG
companies
can
effectively
engage
with
the
evolving
consumer
and
secure
their
position
in
the
market.
By
continuously
monitoring
consumer
behavior
and
implementing
agile
marketing
strategies,
businesses
can
navigate
the
future
with
confidence,
seizing
opportunities
and
staying
ahead
in
this
ever-changing
industry.

Impact
of
Technology
on
Consumer
Behaviour
The
influence
of
technology
on
consumer
behavior:
Impossible
to
ignore
‚Äç
New
technology
has
empowered
consumers.
They
have
unlimited
access
to
information
and
demand
products
and
services
when
they
want.
Social
media
has
given
consumers
a
bigger
voice
and
new
channels
to
communicate
with
brands
and
share
their
opinions
with
peers.
As
the
speed
of
technology
and
trends
in
consumer
behavior
accelerate,
companies
have
to
evolve
quickly.
The
brands
that
deliver
on
consumer
demands
will
thrive,
and
those
that
are
slow
to
react
will
not
survive.
The
3
effects
of
technology
on
today's
consumer:
‚Äç
1.
Consumers
Are
More
Connected
‚Äç
Consumers
are
more
connected
to
business
than
ever
before.
Using
smartphones,
they
can
research
products,
ask
sales
questions,
and
purchase
products
no
matter
where
they
are
and
what
they
are
doing.
For
example,
the
time
spent
commuting
to
work
on
a
train
or
bus
has
been
massively
changed
because
of
technology
and
connected
devices.
According
to
a
study
by
the
Centre
for
Economics
and
Business
Research,
UK
consumers
spend
over
¬£22.8
billion
per
year
online
shopping
while
using
public
transport.
When
it
comes
to
social
media,
consumers
use
these
channels
to
interact
with
brands
and
submit
customer
service
queries.
But
also
as
a
resource
to
help
them
make
purchasing
decisions.
According
to
GlobalWebIndex,
54%
of
social
media
users
have
used
social
media
to
research
products.
With
consumers
becoming
hyper-connected,
there
is
an
increasing
number
of
opportunities
to
engage
new
and
existing
customers.
However,
companies
need
to
understand
how
they
can
cut
through
the
noise
and
meet
consumer
demand.
‚Äç
What
Do
Businesses
Need
to
Do?
‚Äç
To
take
advantage
of
this
change
in
consumer
behaviour,
it's
vital
that
the
brand
has
a
strong
social
media
and
digital
presence.
That
starts
with
a
dynamic
digital
ecosystem.
Companies
need
to
integrate
all
marketing
channels
to
deliver
a
cohesive
customer
experience
irrespective
of
the
channel
used
to
reach
your
business.
There
are
more
opportunities
to
engage
consumers
and
improve
sales
revenue,
but
only
if
your
business
is
equipped
with
the
right
tools
and
data
infrastructure
to
capitalize.
Companies
need
a
deep
understanding
of
their
customers
and
their
shopping
behaviour
to
deliver
seamless
experiences
consumers
demand.
That's
only
possible
when
customer
data
is
effectively
utilized.
The
success
of
an
omnichannel
marketing
strategy
depends
entirely
on
the
end-user
experience
-
the
customer.
As
consumers
switch
between
channels,
devices,
e-commerce,
and
brick-and-mortar
stores,
the
transition
should
be
seamless.
For
example,
a
shopper
might
discover
a
product
on
Facebook
and
ask
a
sales
question
on
the
platform.
After
receiving
an
answer,
the
shopper
visits
the
company
website
to
complete
the
purchase
but
elects
to
pick
up
the
product
in-store.
The
transition
between
digital
channels
and
e-commerce
to
brick-and-mortar
should
be
smooth.
All
of
the
touchpoints
in
the
journey
contribute
to
a
strong
customer
experience
and
a
successful
omnichannel
marketing
strategy.
‚Äç

Consumers
Use
Multiple
Devices
‚Äç
In
2019,
mobile
accounted
for
50.44%
of
total
global
internet
traffic
and
77%
of
total
digital
minutes
in
the
US.
Along
with
increased
household
penetration
of
tablets
and
wearables,
consumers
use
a
wide
variety
of
devices
to
access
the
internet
and
purchase
products.
Consumers
don't
use
a
single
device
throughout
the
buyer's
journey.
According
to
a
Google
report,
90%
of
consumers
use
more
than
one
device
to
accomplish
a
single
task
online.
A
shopper
looking
to
purchase
a
product
might
start
the
journey
after
seeing
an
advertisement
on
television
and
research
products
using
their
smartphone.
After
evaluating
different
products,
they
might
use
their
laptop
to
check
pricing
and
complete
the
purchase.
Companies
need
to
be
there
with
the
right
messaging
at
the
right
time,
whichever
device
their
customer
uses
to
reach
out.
Determining
how
to
reach
every
audience
segment
and
how
digital
touchpoints
interconnect
is
the
challenge
that
needs
to
be
overcome.
‚Äç
What
Do
Businesses
Need
to
Do?
‚Äç
Companies
need
to
build
an
omnichannel
marketing
strategy
to
be
flexible
to
the
influence
of
technology
on
consumer
behaviour.
An
omnichannel
strategy
enables
the
brand
to
create
personalized,
contextually
relevant
experiences
that
engage
consumers
in
the
right
place,
at
the
right
time,
and
with
the
right
message
as
they
move
between
devices.
Remarketing

Omnichannel
means
not

integration
of
digital
channels
but
also
the
in-store
experience
provided
to
customers.
Location-based

be

for

This

Have

competitors
and
the
experience
they
receive
from
Amazon,
Netflix,
etc.
Consumers
expect
more
responsive,
relevant,
and
targeted
communication,
products,
and
services
from
the
companies
they
buy
from.
Companies
used
to
have
set
business
hours,
and
consumers
would
have
to
wait
before
contacting
a
customer
service
representative
or
purchasing
a
product.
Consumers
now
expect
tailored
experiences
on
demand.
If
a
consumer
is
forced
to
wait
for
a
response
from
customer
service
or
to
buy
a
product,
they
will
find
a
competitor
that
offers
a
better
experience.
The
bar
for
satisfactory
customer
experience
is
higher,
with
consumers
expecting
more
and
more
from
companies.
Consumers
are
aware
of
their
power
and
will
use
it
when
they
don't
receive
a
positive
experience
when
dealing
with
a
company.
According
to
a
study
by
American
Express,
over
50%
of
Americans
have
scrapped
a
planned
purchase
because
of
a
bad
customer
experience,
and
74%
of
people
have
switched
brands
because
the
purchasing
process
was
too
difficult.
For
businesses
that
fail
to
acknowledge
and
meet
consumer
demands,
smaller
market
share
and
irrelevance
will
result.

While
the
influence
of
technology
on
consumer
behavior
is
the
cause
of
higher
expectations,
it
also
offers
companies
solutions
to
meet
those
expectations.
Marketing
automation
software
and
AI-powered
chatbots
enable
brands
to
better
communicate
with
their
customers.
Chatbots
are
becoming
increasingly
integrated
into
the
everyday
lives
of
consumers.
According
to
Mobile
Marketer,
40%
of
millennials
interact
with
chatbots
daily.
AI-powered
chatbots
enable
companies
to
be
there
with
relevant
messaging
and
information
whenever
the
consumer
chooses
to
reach
out.
This
has
a
significant
impact
on
customer
service,
and
the
experience
brands
can
offer
to
their
customers.
Consumers
are
also
increasingly
more
willing
to
purchase
directly
through
chatbots.
According
to
HubSpot's
research,
47%
of
consumers
are
open
to
making
a
purchase
from
a
chatbot.
Chatbots
also
provide
detailed
records
of
conversations
with
customers.
This
provides
a
new
stream
of
data
that
can
be
analyzed
to
reveal
insights
on
consumer
pain
points
and
ways
to
improve
products
and
services.
As
more
and
more
companies
utilize
AI
to
empower
their
customer
communications
and
marketing,
consumer
expectations
will
increase
even
further.
Companies
need
to
prepare
and
equip
their
departments
with
the
tools
they
need
to
provide
a
consistently
high-quality
experience
that
exceeds
their
customers'
expectations.
‚Äç
‚Äç
Conclusion
Technology
is
continually
evolving
and
will
always
impact
consumer
behavior.
The
speed
of
that
change
is
getting
faster
and
faster.
With
IoT
and
5G
still
emerging,
companies
need
to
prepare
by
identifying
trends
now
and
capitalizing
before
it
is
too
late.
The
influence
of
technology
is
a
powerful
catalyst
for
change.
If
companies
don't
move
with
technology,
they
will
be
left
behind
and
see
their
market
share
fall.

the
Shifting
Tides:
Consumer
Behaviour
Trends
Oct
3,
2023
Consumer
behaviour
has
undergone
a
tsunami
of
changes
in
the
past
2
years,
moving
in
paradoxical
directions.
Consequently,
the
consumer
products,
hospitality,
and
retail
sectors
have
experienced
significant
disruptions.
A
key
takeaway
from
this
period
is
that
companies
must
find
innovative
ways
to
engage
consumers
in
a
fiercely
competitive
landscape
where
physical
and
digital
experiences
are
converging.
Leading
consumer-centric
businesses
now
prioritize
listening
to
consumers
due
to
the
rapidly
evolving
and
sometimes
contradictory
nature
of
consumer
sentiment
and
behaviour.
Today‚Äôs
consumers
are
both
cost-conscious
and
willing
to
indulge,
gravitating
towards
both
established
giants
and
emerging
niche
brands.
Staying
attuned
to
these
shifts
is
challenging
yet
crucial
for
companies
but
swift
decision-making
to
meet
consumer
expectations
in
this
diverse
landscape
is
paramount.
Technological
advancements
empower
consumer-oriented
companies
spanning
diverse
sectors
to
harness
consumer
data,
facilitating
personalized
experiences.
Salesforce
research
reveals
that
66%
of
consumers
expect
companies
to
understand
their
unique
needs,
with
52%
anticipating
personalized
offers.
This
underscores
the
need
to
move
beyond
one-size-fits-all
approaches
and
utilize
data
and
behavioural
science
to
discern
what
consumers
want
and
when
they
want
it.
Trading
down¬†and¬†indulging
selectively
In
today‚Äôs
dynamic
consumer
landscape,
a
unique
trend
has
emerged
‚Äì
consumers
are
trading
down
while
splurging
selectively.
While
trading
down
involves
making
cost-conscious
choices
in
everyday
purchases,
consumers
seek
value
without
compromising
quality,
favouring
store
brands
and
generic
options
over
premium
labels.
At
the
same
time,
they‚Äôre
embracing
selective
splurges,
allocating
their
budget
to
experiences
and
products
that
align
with
their
passions
and
values.
Globally,
2/3rds
are
trading
down
by
opting
for
cheaper
or
private-label
items.
While
in
Europe,
84%
equate
branded
and
private-label
quality,
in
China,
consumers
are
increasingly
price-conscious,
actively
pursuing
discounts.
McKinsey‚Äôs
report
reveals
a
paradox
in
U.S.
consumer
behavior
amidst
rising
inflation.
Despite
inflation
worries
and
job
insecurity,
shoppers
are
selectively
splurging
and
trading
down
with
pre-pandemic
spending
patterns
varying
in
their
resurgence.
Meanwhile,
44%
of
global
consumers
(60%
among
Gen
Z
and
millennials)
intend
to
indulge,
especially
in
experiential
or
instantly
gratifying
purchases
like
dining
or
travel.
Regional
differences
link
this
intent
to
economic
optimism,
with
77%
of
Indians
planning
to
splurge
compared
to
just
26%
of
Japanese
consumers.
People
are
redefining
luxury,
valuing
experiences
over
possessions
and
opting
for
eco-friendly,
ethical
brands.
This
balanced
approach
allows
consumers
to
maintain
a
sense
of
indulgence
while
adhering
to
responsible
consumption.
Consequently,
companies
need
a
nuanced
understanding
of
these
trends
and
consumer
segments,
as
splurging
in
one
area
may
lead
to
value-seeking
in
another.
Embracing
brands
and
channels
that
enable
shopping
anywhere,
anytime
Consumer
spending
habits
have
shifted
significantly
towards
online
and
discount
channels,
signalling
a
crucial
change
in
shopping
preferences.
The
rise
of
omnichannel
retail
has
transformed
consumer
shopping
platforms,
with
the
e-commerce
market
poised
to
reach
$7.4
trillion
by
2025,
driven
by
the
focus
on
omnichannel
experiences.
Gone
are
the
days
when
shopping
was
confined
to
physical
stores
or
a
single
online
channel.
More
than
60%
of
US
and
Asian
consumers
plan
to
continue
using
channels
they
tried
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic,
such
as
grocery
delivery
and
social
commerce.
In
the
current
purchase
journey,
75%
consumers
desire
seamless
omnichannel
experiences.
However,
only
a
quarter
are
satisfied
with
the
current
offerings
from
retailers.
This
omnichannel
shift
gives
consumers
greater
flexibility,
convenience,
and
choice,
allowing
them
to
research
products
online,
test
them
in-store,
and
make
purchases
through
their
preferred
channel.
Retailers,
in
turn,
benefit
from
this
transformation
by
gaining
deeper
insights
into
customer
behaviour
and
preferences,
facilitating
personalized
marketing
and
improved
customer
retention.
This
mutually
beneficial
relationship
fosters
stronger
brand
loyalty
and
fuels
growth
in
the
ever-evolving
retail
landscape.
As
the
retail
landscape
continues
to
evolve,
embracing
omnichannel
strategies
is
no
longer
an
option
but
a
necessity
for
brands
to
thrive
in
this
dynamic
marketplace.
Mere
online
and
physical
store
presence
falls
short
if
consumer
interactions
lack
seamlessness.
For
example,
shoppers
now
expect
in-store
staff
to
access
their
online
purchase
history
for
tailored
recommendations
and
to
earn
loyalty
points
when
ordering
food
online.
Meeting
these
demands
is
essential
in
catering
to
today‚Äôs
digitally
savvy
consumers
who
seek
connected,
personalized
experiences.
Hyper-personalisation
In
a
digital
era
where
it
appears
that
nearly
everyone
is
embracing
personalization,
the
paramount
standard
is
now
set
by
hyper-personalized,
varied
customer
experiences.
Hyper-personalization
in
consumer
behaviour
is
a
cutting-edge
approach
that
leverages
advanced
data
analytics
and
artificial
intelligence
to
deliver
tailor-made
experiences.
Afterall,
the
more
you
understand
your
users,
the
better
you‚Äôll
serve
your
users.
Unlike
traditional
personalization,
hyper-personalization
goes
beyond
basic
demographics
to
understand
individual
preferences,
behaviours,
and
context.
It
crafts
unique
customer
journeys,
curating
content,
products,
and
services
in
real-time.
Behavioural
data
enables
real-time
delivery
of
tailored
promotions
and
messaging,
enhancing
the
brand
experience
and
deepening
consumer
understanding.
Moreover,
this
data
serves
a
dual
benefit
by
informing
content
strategy
and
expanding
social
influence
for
the
brand.
This
phenomenon
is
reshaping
industries
by
enhancing
customer
engagement
and
satisfaction.
By
analysing
vast
data
sets,
companies
can
predict
consumer
needs
and
desires,
allowing
for
highly
targeted
marketing
campaigns,
product
recommendations,
content
creation,
customer
experience
and
others.¬†For
instance,
Amazon
analyses
customer
browsing
and
purchase
history
to
provide
personalized
product
recommendations
and,
Netflix
utilizes
hyper-personalization
to
recommend
movies
and
TV
shows
based
on
a
user‚Äôs
viewing
history.
Their
recommendation
algorithm
analyses
not
only
what
you‚Äôve
watched
but
also
your
viewing
patterns
and
preferences.
However,
hyper-personalization
also
raises
concerns
about
privacy
and
data
security.
And
therefore,
striking
the
right
balance
between
providing
customized
experiences
and
respecting
personal
boundaries
is
crucial.
As
consumer
expectations
evolve,
hyper-personalization
is
becoming
the
new
norm.
It‚Äôs
a
paradigm
shift
that‚Äôs
here
to
stay,
offering
exciting
opportunities
and
challenges
for
brands
and
consumers
alike.
Balancing
the
comfort
of
the
familiar
with
the
thrill
of
brand
exploration
Consumers
today
are
navigating
a
fascinating
duality:
finding
comfort
in
familiarity
while
also
open
to
trying
different
brands
for
the
same/different
type
of
product.
On
one
hand,
they
seek
the
reliability
and
nostalgia
associated
with
trusted
brands,
providing
a
sense
of
security
in
uncertain
times.
On
the
other
hand,
they‚Äôre
increasingly
open
to
experimenting
with
new
products
and
services,
driven
by
curiosity
and
the
desire
for
novelty.
This
evolving
consumer
behavior
presents
a
unique
challenge
for
brands,
and
they
must
strike
a
delicate
balance
between
maintaining
brand
loyalty
by
delivering
consistent
experiences
and
enticing
adventurous
consumers
with
fresh
offerings.
Adapting
to
this
paradox
is
key
to
thriving
in
today‚Äôs
dynamic
marketplace.
Historically,
established
brands
have
held
sway
in
the
consumer
market
during
periods
of
instability.
In
the
US
market,
large
brands
experienced
a
50%
growth
peak
amid
the
pandemic.
But
consumers
are
also
trying
new
brands:
one
in
three
consumers
did
so
in
the
past
6
months.
Gen
Zs
and
millennials
are
especially
susceptible
to
brand
switching,
as
they
are
5
times
more
likely
than
older
generations
to
believe
that
newer
brands
are
better
or
more
innovative
than
established
brands.
Today‚Äôs
consumers
purchase
a
range
of
products
to
meet
specific
needs,
diverging
from
the
past
when
one
product
sufficed.
For
instance,
households
no
longer
rely
on
just
one
milk
type;
they
may
consume
cow‚Äôs
milk,
high-protein
milk,
and
plant-based
alternatives
like
oat
or
coconut
milk.
Similarly,
consumers
exhibit
brand
fluidity
across
items
like
smartphones,
clothing,
or
coffee,
forsaking
strict
brand
allegiance.
Various
factors
drive
this
behaviour,
including
price
sensitivity,
evolving
tastes,
diverse
alternatives,
and
curiosity.
In
response,
businesses
in
marketing
and
branding
strive
to
foster
brand
loyalty
and
discourage
switching.
They
do
so
by
offering
distinct
value,
nurturing
emotional
connections,
and
ensuring
consistent
quality
and
experiences
to
encourage
repeat
purchases
and
brand
preference.
Demanding
sustainability¬†and¬†affordability
Today‚Äôs
consumers
are
demanding
a
dual
focus
on
sustainability
and
affordability.
They‚Äôre
increasingly
conscious
of
the
environmental
impact
of
their
purchases
and
are
actively
seeking
eco-friendly
options.
Simultaneously,
they‚Äôre
mindful
of
their
budgets,
expecting
sustainable
choices
not
to
break
the
bank.
Consumers
increasingly
favour
sustainable
products,
with
84%
considering
sustainability
very
important
in
their
buying
choices.
Yet,
in
times
of
inflation,
50%
remain
uncertain
about
paying
a
premium
for
sustainability.
From
affordable
EVs
to
budget-friendly
organic
foods
and
clothes,
companies
are
realizing
that
sustainability
is
no
longer
a
premium
add-on
but
a
necessity.
This
consumer-driven
demand
is
reshaping
markets,
encouraging
responsible
practices,
and
ultimately
creating
a
win-win
scenario
for
both
the
planet
and
our
wallets.

1)
Artificial
Intelligence
Artificial
Intelligence
is
revolutionizing
the
marketing
world
and
will
be
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
marketing
trends
in
2023.
A
lot
of
the
marketing
technology
you
use
today
including
marketing
automation
and
advertising
is
powered
by
Artificial
intelligence.
Marketers
knowing
or
unknowingly
are
adopting
Artificial
Intelligence-powered
execution.
A
MarTech
stack
powered
by
Artificial
Intelligence
is
bound
to
deliver
superior
results
for
marketers.
The
global
AI
market,
with
a
value
of
approximately
US$142.3
dollars
in
2023,
is
experiencing
continuous
growth
due
to
the
substantial
investments
it
attracts.
Projections
indicate
that
the
global
artificial
intelligence
market
is
expected
to
expand
at
a
compound
annual
growth
rate
(CAGR)
of
37.3%
from
2023
to
2030,
ultimately
reaching
a
projected
value
of
US$1,811.8
billion
by
2030.
In
marketing,
some
of
the
practical
implementations
of
artificial
intelligence
include:
2)
Conversational
Marketing
Conversational
marketing
is
another
tool
that
needs
to
be
part
of
your
Maretch
stack
in
2023
and
beyond.
The
concept
facilitates
a
real-time
one-to-one
connection
between
marketers
and
customers.
People
seek
an
instant
response
to
their
queries
when
they
have
in
their
minds.
As
per
the
findings
of
the
Zendesk
Customer
Experience
Trends
Report
2023,
it
was
revealed
that
72%
of
customers
express
a
desire
for
immediate
service,
indicating
their
expectation
for
prompt
responses
and
resolutions.
Additionally,
a
significant
70%
of
customers
expect
anyone
they
interact
with
to
possess
full
context,
emphasizing
the
importance
of
having
comprehensive
knowledge
and
understanding
of
their
previous
interactions
and
concerns.Chatbots
are
the
best
technique
to
keep
your
marketing
efforts
interactive.
According
to
market
forecasts,
the
chatbot
market
is
anticipated
to
reach
a
size
of
approximately
1.25
billion
U.S.
dollars
by
the
year
2025.
The
AI-powered
technology
has
made
it
convenient
for
the
website
visitors
to
get
intelligent
and
engaging
answers
when
and
where
they
want.
The
idea
behind
conversational
marketing
is
to
intensify
the
user
experience
with
the
help
of
a
feedback-driven
mode,
enabling
higher
engagement
and
loyalty.
Some
interesting
stats:
See
here
in
this
example,
AI-based
chatbot
is
assisting
the
customer
in
finalizing
his
pizza
order.
The
chatbot
is
suggesting
him
option,
based
on
his
past
orders
with
dominos.
In
addition
to
the
previously
mentioned
advantages,

following
trends
and
forecasts
for
chatbots
in
2023:
3)
Personalization
Personalization
is
key
to
generate
maximum
conversation
from
your
online
assets
by
providing
relevant
content/information
to
visitors/prospects.
Whether
it‚Äôs
a
website,
email
campaign
or
online
buying,
everyone
expects
a
personalized
experience.
Personalization
will
be
a
prominent
marketing
trend
in
2023
and
beyond
as
organizations
acknowledge
its
importance
in
satisfying
client
expectations
and
achieving
marketing
success.
While
many
businesses
have
already
adopted
personalization,
the
trend
is
projected
to
accelerate
as
enterprises
strive
to
create
personalized
experiences
and
build
consumer
connections.
Businesses
will
engage
in
strategies
and
technology
to
deliver
tailored
interactions
at
scale,
boosting
conversion
rates
and
customer
happiness.
This
includes
everything
from
dynamic
website
content
to
targeted
email
marketing
and
personalized
product
suggestions.
Businesses
that
embrace
personalization
have
enormous
potential
in
the
future,
as
it
helps
them
to
stand
out
in
a
congested
digital
market
and
develop
deep
connections
with
their
audience.
Personalized
marketing
is
all
about
collecting
good
quality
demographic
and
behavioral
data
of
prospects
and
customers
and
using
it
to
provide
highly
relevant
and
engaging
communications.
Netflix
and
Amazon
are
the
best
examples
to
start
with.
Consider
their
tailored
recommended
products
or
movie
titles
to
all
visitors/subscribers.
‚ÄúPersonalized,
triggered
emails
based
on
behavior
are
3x
better
than
batch-and-blast
emails.‚Äù
-
Kevin
George
from
EmailMonks
Another
remarkable
example
demonstrating
the
power
of
personalization
is
Cadbury‚Äôs
personalized
video
campaign
in
Australia.
The
campaign
was
based
on
the
information
(age,
location,
and
preferences)
they
collected
from
the
Facebook
profiles
of
their
users.
The
results
were
astonishing;
the
campaign
generated
a
65%
increase
in
click-through
rate
and
a
33.6%
increase
in
conversion
rate.
Another
fascinating
example
is
Spotify.
It
utilizes
personalization
to
curate
customized
playlists
and
recommendations
for
its
users
based
on
their
music
preferences,
listening
habits,
and
favorite
genres.
Through
its
""Discover
Weekly""
and
""Daily
Mix""
features,
Spotify
delivers
personalized
music
recommendations,
ensuring
a
tailored
and
enjoyable
listening
experience.
Starbucks
is
also
a
perfect
example
of
personalization,
as
it
incorporates
personalization
through
its
loyalty
program
and
mobile
app.
The
company
collects
customer
data,
such
as
purchase
history
and
beverage
preferences,
to
offer
personalized
recommendations,
discounts,
and
rewards.
Customers
can
also
customize
their
orders
using
the
app,
allowing
for
a
personalized
and
convenient
ordering
process.
4)
Messaging
Apps
Gone
are
the
days
when
social
messaging
apps
like
WhatsApp,
Facebook
Messenger,
etc,
were
just
for
personal
messaging
with
friends.
Interacting
with
business
is
as
convenient
as
with
your
friends
over
these
messaging
apps.
Adoption
of
Messaging
Apps
in
Business
Using
social
messaging
apps
for
one-to-one
interaction
with
customers
will
be
another
booming
marketing
trend
in
2023.
These
social
messaging
apps
are
already
contributing
a
lot
in
personalized
marketing
and
are
expected
to
do
more
in
the
coming
years.
Sending
direct
messaging
or
responding
to
chat
apps
adds
value
to
customer
experience.
More
and
more
businesses
are
building
a
presence
on
messaging
apps
and
providing
the
omnichannel
experience
engaging
with
customers
through
their
preferred
channel
for
communication.
5)
Content
Marketing
and
SEO
In
the
ever-evolving
landscape
of
digital
marketing,
the
symbiotic
relationship
between
content
marketing
and
SEO
remains
strong.
However,
as
we
look
towards
2023
and
beyond,
the
future
of
digital
marketing
will
continue
to
see
content
marketing
asserting
its
dominance
over
SEO.
Industry
experts
now
advocate
for
a
more
balanced
and
holistic
approach
that
prioritizes
a
comprehensive
content
marketing
strategy
over
relying
solely
on
traditional
SEO
tactics
to
foster
business
growth.
Delivering
relevant
content
to
your
target
audience
through
blogs,
whitepapers,
or
webinars
can
significantly
impact
lead
generation.
When
you
create
valuable
and
informative
content
that
addresses
the
pain
points
and
interests
of
your
audience,
you
establish
your
expertise
and
build
trust
with
potential
customers.
According
to
a
survey,
38%
of
marketers
find
that
focusing
on
customer
pain
points
and
questions
helps
boost
the
visibility
of
blog
content
in
search
engine
results
pages
(SERPs).
Additionally,
45%
of
marketers
have
seen
positive
results
by
incorporating
related
keywords
alongside
primary
keywords.
These
strategies
position
your
business
as
a
trustworthy
source
of
information
and
foster
a
strong
connection
with
your
audience.
By
understanding
and
catering
to
their
needs,
you
can
engage
and
attract
potential
leads,
ultimately
driving
business
growth.
‚ÄúRather
than
chase
the
latest
SEO
trends,
it‚Äôs
more
important
to
ensure
a
site
has
fast
speeds,
useful
links,
and
well-written
content.‚Äù
-
John
Mueller
from
Google
The
vast
majority
of
B2B
content
marketers
feel
that
the
strategic
production
and
extensive
dissemination
of
relevant
content
is
critical
in
persuading
their
target
audience
to
establish
a
profound
sense
of
legitimacy
and
confidence
in
their
business.
This
idea
derives
from
the
realization
that
providing
quality
and
personalized
content
develops
genuine
relationships
with
prospects
and
consumers,
thus
developing
a
strong
foundation
of
trust
and
confidence
in
the
business.
6)
Interactive
Content
One
of
the
fastest-growing
digital
marketing
trends
is
interactive
content.
It
allows
users
for
active
engagement
and
to
be
an
integral
part
of
the
two-way
experience.
Marketers
are
already
leveraging
interactive
content
to
help
prospects
make
their
buying
decisions
and
in
2023
and
beyond
this
marketing
trend
will
accelerate.
For
example,
think
about:
The
audience
engagement
is
higher
with
interactive
content.
Here
are
some
interesting
stats:
7)
Voice
Search
Strategy
The
voice
search
technology
is
on
the
rise
and
will
continue
to
rise
even
in
the
coming
years.
The
increasing
number
of
voice
search
users
will
force
marketers
to
re-design
their
marketing
strategies
for
2023.
Content
that
receives
high
levels
of
social
engagement
tends
to
perform
well
in
voice
search.
On
average,
a
voice
search
result
has
1,199
Facebook
shares
and
44
Tweets.
With
evolving
artificial
intelligence
technology
the
voice
assistants
like
Alexa,
Siri,
and
Google
have
improved
a
lot
and
have
greatly
reduced
search
result
errors.
Check
out
these
stats
to
know
how
voice
search
will
affect
your
industry:
Being
faster,
accurate
and
convenient,
voice
search
improves
the
user
experience.
That
means
if
you
optimize
your
website
for
voice
search,
you
will
have
brighter
chances
of
showing
up
on
the
top
results
produced
by
voice
assistants.
8)
Influencer
Marketing
Influencer
marketing
is
a
progressive
version
of
word-of-mouth
marketing
that
emphasis
using
key
industry
leaders
to
escalate
your
brand
message
to
a
larger
audience.
Influencers
can
be
famous
silver-screen
celebrities.
But
lately,
some
LinkedIn,
Instagram,
and
YouTube
users
have
built
a
huge
niche
following.
These
online
industry-specific
personalities
are
influencers
who
can
spread
your
business
through
their
social
channels.
The
coming
year
will
witness
the
dominance
of
local
influencers
over
celebrities,
and
this
marketing
concept
will
be
one
of
the
key
marketing
trends
in
2023.
Because
influencer
marketing
is
considered
more
honest
and
real
than
corporate
advertising:
9)
Geo-Fenced
Marketing
The
location-based
marketing
idea
-
Geo-fencing
is
nothing
new
for
marketers.
We
expect
a
significant
increase
in
the
usage
of
geofencing
marketing
trends
in
2023
and
beyond.
The
geofencing
market
industry
is
expected
to
experience
significant
growth,
with
projections
indicating
an
increase
from
$1.2
billion
in
2030
to
$4.5
billion
by
2030.
This
growth
is
estimated
to
have
a
compound
annual
growth
rate
(CAGR)
of
24.10%.
When
you
combine
personalization
and
location-based
targeting
the
results
can
be
very
powerful.
Imagine
knowing
someone‚Äôs
personal
preferences
from
their
social
media
accounts
and
using
that
to
serve
ads
that
are
most
relevant
to
them
as
they
are
walking
through
a
mall.
10)
The
Next
Generation
of
Marketing
Analytics
The
customer
journey
has
become
more
complex
in
this
omnichannel
age.
An
average
consumer
engages
multiple
times
with
a
brand
before
they
make
a
purchase.
With
multiple
channels
to
manage
and
to
keep
track
of,
the
tracking
&
analyzing
seems
to
have
become
a
monstrous
job.
Measuring
results
and
being
able
to
attribute
them
accurately
has
been
and
will
be
of
tremendous
importance.
More
investment
will
be
made
in
the
analytics
and
businesses
will
explore
something
beyond
the
basic
analytics.
Advanced
Business
Intelligence
solutions
that
help
in
better
decision
making
are
going
to
see
a
rise
in
2023
and
beyond.
Key
Factors
Shaping
Market
Trends,
in
the
Global
Economy
A.
Examining
the
Influence
of
Macroeconomic
Elements
on
Market
Trends
The
global
economy
is
greatly
impacted
by
factors,
such
as
the
growth
of
Gross
Domestic
Product
(GDP)
inflation
rates
and
interest
rates.
These
elements
play
a
role
in
shaping
market
trends
and
overall
economic
conditions.
GDP
growth
serves
as
an
indicator
of
an
economy's
health
and
performance.
High
GDP
growth
rates
indicate
an
economy
with
promising
market
potential
whereas
low
growth
rates
may
signal
a
slowdown
that
negatively
affects
market
trends.
On
the
other
hand
inflation
measures
the
rate
at
which
prices
for
goods
and
services
are
increasing
while
diminishing
the
purchasing
power
of
currency.
High
levels
of
inflation
can
lead
to
reduced
consumer
spending
and
investment
thereby
impacting
sector
market
trends.
Interest
rates
also
exert
an
influence
on
market
trends.
Changes
in
interest
rates
affect
borrowing
costs,
which
subsequently
impact
consumer
spending
patterns
and
business
investment
decisions.
Higher
interest
rates
can
curtail
consumer
spending
and
business
investments
leading
to
a
slowdown
in
market
trends.
B.
The
Impact
of
Global
Trade
Patterns
on
Market
Trends
trade
patterns
hold
significance
in
shaping
market
trends
as
they
determine

occur;
foresight
and
strategic
planning
are
essential.
Here,
we
delve
into
15
pivotal
consumer
trends
poised
to
redefine
the
market
landscape
in
2024.
These
trends
are
not
just
a
passing
wave;
they
are
powerful
currents
reshaping
industries
ranging
from
Advertising
and
Agriculture
to
E-commerce,
Technology,
and
Telecommunications.
Embracing
these
trends
means
more
than
just
staying
relevant.
It‚Äôs
about
seizing
opportunities
in
a
rapidly
evolving
marketplace,
delivering
value
that
resonates
with
modern
consumers,
and
ultimately,
shaping
the
future
of
your
industry.
Trend
1:
Sustainable
and
Ethical
Practices
The
push
for
sustainable
and
ethical
practices
has
moved
from
a
niche
concern
to
a
mainstream
demand
in
a
world
increasingly
conscious
of
its
ecological
footprint
and
societal
impact.
This
paradigm
shift
is
not
just
a
moral
awakening
but
a
response
to
the
growing
evidence
of
climate
change
and
social
inequality.
A
recent
survey
revealed
that
73%
of
global
consumers
are
willing
to
change
their
consumption
habits
to
reduce
environmental
impact.
This
staggering
statistic
underscores
the
importance
of
this
trend.
The
emergence
of
this
trend
can
be
traced
back
to
the
growing
awareness
and
accessibility
of
information
regarding
environmental
and
social
issues.
Social
media
and
digital
platforms
have
played
a
pivotal
role
in
illuminating
the
consequences
of
unsustainable
practices.
The
result
is
a
more
informed
and
conscientious
consumer
base,
demanding
transparency,
sustainability,
and
ethical
behaviour
from
brands.
In
the
agriculture
industry,
this
trend
manifests
as
a
surge
in
organic
and
regenerative
farming
practices.
Consumers
are
increasingly
seeking
products
that
are
healthy
for
them
and
beneficial
for
the
planet.
Consumer
behaviour
is
impacting
food
production.
The
Organic
Trade
Association
noted
a
rise
in
organic
food
sales
by
4%
in
2022,
reaching
a
record
$60
billion
in
sales
within
the
US
that
year,
a
clear
indication
of
this
growing
demand.
Moreover,
adopting
sustainable
agriculture
practices
is
not
just
a
consumer
preference
but
also
a
business
imperative.
According
to
the
Business
and
Sustainable
Development
Commission,
sustainable
business
models
in
the
food
and
agriculture
sector
could
open
economic
opportunities
worth
up
to
$2.3
trillion
annually
by
2030.
Consumer
Packaged
Goods
(CPG)
companies
also
feel
this
trend‚Äôs
impact.
There
is
a
notable
shift
towards
products
with
sustainable
packaging,
ethically
sourced
ingredients,
and
a
transparent
supply
chain.
A
study
by
the
Boston
Consulting
Group
highlights
that
brands
with
a
higher
positive
impact
on
society
grow
up
to
4.5
times
faster
than
those
with
a
lower
impact.
This
trend
pushes
CPG
companies
to
rethink
their
product
lifecycle,
from
sourcing
to
packaging
and
disposal.
The
automotive
industry
is
also
undergoing
a
significant
transformation,
with
sustainability
taking
centre
stage.
Electric
vehicles
(EVs)
are
at
the
forefront
of
this
change.
Bloomberg
forecasts
that
EVs
will
account
for
10%
of
global
passenger
vehicle
sales
by
2025,
up
from
just
3%
in
2020.
Consumer
demand,
regulatory
pressures,
and
technological
advancements
drive
this
shift.
Automotive
giants
are
investing
heavily
in
sustainable
technologies,
recognising
that
the
industry‚Äôs
future
is
inextricably
linked
to
environmental
stewardship.
In
conclusion,
sustainable
and
ethical
practices
are
no
longer
optional
but
critical
to
business
strategy
across
various
sectors.
For
industries
like
Agriculture,
CPG,
and
Automotive,
adapting
to
this
trend
is
about
meeting
consumer
demands
and
ensuring
long-term
viability
in
an
increasingly
conscientious
global
market.
As
brands
navigate
this
shift,
the
ones
that
authentically
embed
sustainability
and
ethics
into
their
core
operations
will
likely
emerge
as
leaders
in
the
new
consumer
landscape
of
2024
and
beyond.
Trend
2:
Personalisation
and
Customisation
The
era
of
one-size-fits-all
is
fading
into
obscurity
as
we
witness
the
rise
of
personalisation
and
customisation
in
consumer
preferences.
Today‚Äôs
consumers
seek
products
and
services
that
cater
to
their
tastes,
needs,
and
preferences.
This
trend
reflects
a
broader
shift
towards
a
more
personalised
consumer
experience,
emphasising
the
individual
rather
than
the
mass
market.
The
root
of
this
trend
lies
in
technological
advancements
that
have
made
data
collection
and
analysis
more
sophisticated
and
accessible.
With
the
advent
of
AI
and
machine
learning,
businesses
can
now
gain
deep
insights
into
consumer
behaviour,
preferences,
and
patterns.
According
to
Salesforce,
66%
of
customers
expect
companies
to
understand
their
unique
needs
and
expectations.
This
expectation
has
set
a
new
standard
in
customer
experience
that
is
tailor-made
and
deeply
personal.
In
e-commerce,
personalisation
has
become
a
key
differentiator.
Amazon‚Äôs
recommendation
algorithm
is
a
prime
example,
often
cited
as
a
significant
driver
of
its
sales,
with
35%
of
purchases
coming
from
product
recommendations
based
on
algorithms.
This
level
of
customisation
enhances
the
shopping
experience,
increases
customer
satisfaction,
and
boosts
loyalty.
For
B2B
companies,
personalisation
has
evolved
from
a
nice-to-have
feature
to
a
critical
business
strategy.
A
study
by
McKinsey
&
Company
shows
that
80%
of
B2B
buyers
now
expect
the
same
buying
experience
as
B2C
customers.
This
includes
personalised
communication,
tailored
solutions,
and
understanding
their
unique
business
challenges.
B2B
businesses
that
have
embraced
this
trend
are
seeing
substantial
benefits,
with
15%
to
20%
higher
customer
satisfaction
rates
and
a
10%
to
15%
increase
in
sales
conversion
rates.
Personalisation
is
taking
on
a
more
sophisticated
form
in
the
technology
sector
with
the
advent
of
customisable
technology
solutions.
Companies
now
offer
products
tailored
to
specific
user
preferences,
from
customisable
software
interfaces
to
hardware
that
can
be
modified
according
to
user
needs.
Apple‚Äôs
iOS,
for
example,
allows
users
to
extensively
tailor
their
phone‚Äôs
functionality
and
interface,
enhancing
user
experience
and
loyalty.
Personalisation
and
customisation
are
more
than
just
marketing
strategies;
they
represent
a
fundamental
shift
in
how
businesses
interact
with
customers.
They
are
about
creating
a
unique
value
proposition
for
each
customer,
fostering
a
deeper
connection
and
a
more
meaningful
relationship.
As
we
move
into
2024,
businesses
across
sectors
like
E-commerce,
B2B,
and
Technology
that
harness
the
power
of
personalisation
and
customisation
will
stay
relevant
and
thrive
in
an
increasingly
competitive
marketplace.
Trend
3:
Digital
and
Augmented
Experiences
The
lines
between
the
physical
and
digital
worlds
continue
to
blur,
giving
rise
to
a
new
era
of
digital
and
augmented
experiences.
This
trend,
propelled
by
advancements
in
AR
(Augmented
Reality),
VR
(Virtual
Reality),
and
AI
(Artificial
Intelligence),
is
reshaping
the
way
consumers
interact
with
the
world
around
them.
It‚Äôs
a
shift
towards
more
immersive,
interactive,
and
personalised
experiences
driven
by
a
desire
for
enhanced
engagement
and
convenience.
The
growth
of
this
trend
can
be
attributed
to
significant
technological
advancements
and
increased
accessibility
to
high-speed
internet
and
smartphones.
According
to
a
report
by
PwC,
the
AR
and
VR
market
is
expected
to
grow
to
$1.5
trillion
by
2030,
highlighting
the
enormous
potential
and
interest
in
these
technologies.
This
growth
is
also
fueled
by
the
increased
consumer
appetite
for
immersive
experiences
that
go
beyond
traditional
media
consumption.
In
the
media
industry,
digital
and
augmented
experiences
are
revolutionising
content
consumption.
Streaming
services
are
experimenting
with
AR
and
VR
to
provide
more
engaging
and
immersive
viewing
experiences.
For
instance,
Netflix‚Äôs
interactive
storytelling,
like
in
‚ÄúBlack
Mirror:
Bandersnatch,‚Äù
where
viewers
make
decisions
that
influence
the
story‚Äôs
outcome,
represents
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
in
this
evolving
landscape.
The
global
video
streaming
market,
estimated
to
reach
$184.3
billion
by
2027,
increasingly
incorporates
these
technologies
to
enhance
viewer
engagement
and
retention.
The
telecommunications
sector
is
also
at
the
forefront
of
this
trend.
With
the
rollout
of
5G
technology,
which
offers
faster
speeds
and
lower
latency,
telecom
companies
are
enabling
more
sophisticated
and
seamless
AR
and
VR
experiences.
For
example,
Verizon‚Äôs
venture
into
5D
technology
promises
to
revolutionise
how
consumers
and
businesses
interact
with
digital
content,
offering
unprecedented
levels
of
interactivity
and
immersion.
Advertising
is
another
industry
transforming
digital
and
augmented
experiences.
Brands
are
leveraging
AR
and
VR
to
create
more
engaging
and
interactive
advertising
campaigns.
A
report
by
eMarketer
predicts
that
58.9
million
people
will
use
VR
and
93.3
million
will
use
AR
at
least
once
per
month
in
the
US
alone.
This
shift
drives
advertisers
to
develop
innovative
campaigns
offering
consumers
a
unique
and
memorable
brand
experience,
increasing
brand
engagement
and
loyalty.
The
trend
of
digital
and
augmented
experiences
clearly
indicates
the
direction
in
which
consumer
preferences
are
heading.
As
we
advance
into
2024,
industries
like
Media,
Telecommunications,
and
Advertising
must
adopt
these
technologies
and
innovate
continuously
to
stay
ahead
in
a
rapidly
evolving
digital
landscape.
Those
who
succeed
in
creating
immersive,
engaging,
and
personalised
experiences
will
capture
the
hearts
and
minds
of
consumers
in
this
new
digital
era.
Trend
4:
Health
and
Wellness
The
surge
in
consumer
consciousness
around
health
and
wellness
marks
a
pivotal
shift
in
lifestyle
choices
and
purchasing
behaviour.
This
trend,
fueled
by
a
growing
awareness
of
the
importance
of
physical
and
mental
well-being,
significantly
influences
various
industry
sectors.
In
an
era
where
health
is
increasingly
viewed
holistically,
consumers
seek
products
and
services
that
contribute
positively
to
their
overall
well-being.
This
trend‚Äôs
roots
can
be
traced
to
a
combination
of
factors,
including
increased
access
to
health-related
information,
a
rise
in
chronic
health
conditions,
and
a
growing
emphasis
on
preventive
healthcare.
A
study
by
the
Global
Wellness
Institute
reveals
that
the
global
wellness
economy
is
valued
at
$4.5
trillion,
indicating
the
vast
scale
and
impact
of
this
trend.
In
the
Food
and
Beverage
industry,
this
shift
towards
health
and
wellness
is
evident
in
the
rising
demand
for
nutritious,
organic,
and
natural
products.
Consumers
are
now
more
inclined
towards
food
and
drinks
that
satisfy
hunger
and
offer
health
benefits.
According
to
a
Nielsen
report,
sales
of
products
with
health
attributes
rose
by
4%
globally,
outpacing
total
store
sales.
This
demand
is
reshaping
the
industry,
with
companies
increasingly
focusing
on
clean
labels,
transparency,
and
health-centric
product
innovations.
The
Animal
Health
sector
is
also
experiencing
a
parallel
shift.
Pet
owners
increasingly
treat
their
pets
as
family
members
and
are
equally
conscious
about
their
health
and
well-being.
The
global
pet
food
market,
expected
to
reach
$128.4
billion
by
2025,
reflects
this
trend.
There‚Äôs
a
growing
demand
for
premium,
organic,
and
specially
formulated
pet
foods
and
products
that
cater
to
pets‚Äô
overall
health,
including
dietary
supplements
and
health-focused
pet
care
products.
We
recently
conducted
a
study
in
the
UK
to
explore
how
brands
can
support
Vets
in
the
current
economic
climate
by
understanding
their
challenges
and
relationship
with
pet
owners.

In
CPG,
the
health
and
wellness
trend
is
prompting
a
reevaluation
of
product
portfolios.
Companies
are
reformulating
products
to
reduce
artificial
ingredients,
sugars,
and
unhealthy
fats.
They
are
also
introducing
new
product
lines
that
align
with
wellness
trends,
such
as
plant-based
alternatives
and
functional
foods.
The
global
functional
food
market
is
projected
to
grow
at
a
CAGR
of
7.7%
between
2020
and
2025,
showcasing
the
sector‚Äôs
response
to
this
health-conscious
wave.
The
health
and
wellness
trend
is
not
just
a
passing
fad
but
a
fundamental
shift
in
consumer
priorities.
As
we
move
into
2024,
the
Food
and
Beverage,
Animal
Health,
and
Consumer
Packaged
Goods
sectors
are
poised
to
see
continued
growth
and
innovation
in
this
space.
Companies
that
can
effectively
tap
into
this
trend
and
offer
products
that
genuinely
contribute
to
the
consumer‚Äôs
overall
well-being
will
be
well-positioned
to
thrive
in
the
coming
years.
Trend
5:
Convenience
and
Speed
In
an
age
where
time
is
a
precious
commodity,
the
demand
for
convenience
and
speed
has
escalated
to
new
heights,
becoming
a
key
determinant
in
consumer
decision-making.
This
trend,
driven
by
a
fast-paced
lifestyle
and
the
digital
revolution,
is
reshaping
consumer
expectations
and
industry
practices
across
various
sectors.
The
essence
of
this
trend
lies
in
the
consumers‚Äô
desire
for
immediate
gratification
and
efficiency
in
every
aspect
of
their
lives.
A
report
by
McKinsey
&
Company
highlights
that
convenience
is
one
of
the
top
factors
customers
consider
when
choosing
where
to
shop,
with
60%
of
global
consumers
citing
it
as
a
key
factor.
In
e-commerce,
convenience
and
speed
are
revolutionising
shopping
experiences.
The
proliferation
of
one-day
or
even
same-day
delivery
services
exemplifies
this
trend.
Amazon,
for
instance,
has
set
a
high
bar
with
its
Prime
service,
offering
fast
and
reliable
delivery.
This
has
led
to
a
competitive
landscape
where
speed
is
a
significant
differentiator.
According
to
Statista,
the
global
e-commerce
market
is
expected
to
reach
$4.99
trillion
by
2028,
with
a
large
part
of
this
growth
attributable
to
enhanced
convenience
and
faster
delivery
times.
The
Food
and
Beverage
industry
is
also
significantly
impacted
by
this
trend.
The
rise
of
meal
delivery
services,
quick-serve
restaurants,
and
on-the-go
food
options
are
responses
to
the
growing
consumer
demand
for
convenience.
A
study
by
the
National
Restaurant
Association
found
that
78%
of
consumers
say
they
order
takeout
or
delivery
at
least
once
a
month,
citing
convenience
as
a
primary
reason.
Furthermore,
there‚Äôs
an
increasing
trend
in
pre-prepared
meal
kits
and
ready-to-eat
meals,
catering
to
time-pressed
consumers
seeking
both
quality
and
convenience.
Financial
Services
have
not
been
left
untouched
by
this
trend.
The
industry
has
seen
a
surge
in
digital
transformation,
aiming
to
provide
faster,
more
convenient
services.
Mobile
banking,
contactless
payments,
and
digital
wallets
are
innovations
catering
to
the
need
for
speed
and
ease.
According
to
a
survey
by
Business
Insider
Intelligence,
89%
of
survey
respondents
reported
using
mobile
banking
for
convenience.
The
industry
is
also
witnessing
the
rise
of
fintech
companies
that
leverage
technology
to
offer
quicker
and
more
user-friendly
financial
solutions.
The
trend
towards
convenience
and
speed
clearly
indicates
the
evolving
consumer
landscape.
As
we
approach
2024,
industries
like
E-commerce,
Food
and
Beverage,
and
Financial
Services
must
continuously
innovate
and
streamline
their
operations
to
meet
these
changing
consumer
demands.
Brands
that
can
effectively
offer
time-saving
solutions
without
compromising
quality
will
gain
a
competitive
edge
in
attracting
and
retaining
customers
in
this
fast-paced
world.
Trend
6:
Value-Driven
Consumption
The
rise
of
value-driven
consumption
marks
a
significant
shift
in
consumer
behaviour,
emphasising
the
importance
of
values
and
ethics
in
purchasing
decisions.
This
trend
reflects
a
growing
consumer
preference
for
brands
and
products
that
align
with
their
personal
beliefs
and
values,
such
as
sustainability,
social
responsibility,
and
ethical
practices.
At
the
heart
of
this
trend
is
an
increasing
awareness
and
concern
for
various
global
issues,
including
environmental
sustainability,
social
justice,
and
ethical
business
practices.
A
report
by
Nielsen
indicates
that
73%
of
global
consumers
say
they
would
change
their
consumption
habits
to
reduce
their
environmental
impact.
In
the
automotive
industry,
value-driven
consumption
is
manifesting
primarily
in
the
increasing
popularity
of
electric
vehicles
(EVs)
and
sustainable
automotive
technologies.
Consumers
actively
seek
out
environmentally
friendly
transportation
options
driven
by
carbon
emissions
and
climate
change
concerns.
The
International
Energy
Agency
(IEA)
reports
that
the
global
electric
car
market
is
set
to
grow
significantly,
with
a
projection
of
125
million
EVs
on
the
road
by
2030.
This
shift
pushes
traditional
automotive
manufacturers
to
invest
heavily
in
electric
and
hybrid
technologies,
redefining
the
industry‚Äôs
future.
CPG
brands
also
feel
this
trend‚Äôs
impact.
There
is
a
growing
demand
for
ethically
sourced,
environmentally
friendly,
and
socially
responsible
products.
This
has
led
to
increased
eco-friendly
packaging,
fair-trade
certifications,
and
transparency
in
supply
chain
practices.
CPG
companies
are
now
more
than
ever
focusing
on
building
brand
loyalty
through
value
alignment
rather
than
just
price
and
quality.
The
agriculture
sector
is
experiencing
a
parallel
shift
towards
sustainable
and
ethical
practices.
Consumers
are
increasingly
aware
of
their
food
choices‚Äô
environmental
and
social
impact.
This
awareness

Social
Media
Influence
The
burgeoning
impact
of
social
media
influence
on
consumer
behaviour
and
industry
practices
has
been
undeniable.
This
trend
has
grown
exponentially
in
recent
years,
transforming
how
brands
interact
with
consumers,
particularly
in
sectors
like
Advertising,
Media,
and
markets
targeting
Kids
and
Youth.
The
ascendancy
of
social
media
as
a
dominant
force
in
shaping
public
opinion
and
consumer
habits
is
underpinned
by
its
vast
reach
and
engagement
levels.
As
of
2023,
there
are
4.62
billion
social
media
users
worldwide,
which
equates
to
58.4%
of
the
global
population.
This
widespread
adoption
has
made
social
media
a
powerful
tool
for
influencing
consumer
decisions.
In
the
advertising
sector,
social
media
platforms
have
evolved
into
crucial
channels
for
reaching
and
engaging
audiences.
Influencer
marketing,
a
strategy
that
leverages
individuals
with
significant
social
media
followings
to
promote
products,
has
become
particularly
effective.
A
survey
by
Mediakix
revealed
that
89%
of
marketers
find
ROI
from
influencer
marketing
comparable
to
or
better
than
other
marketing
channels.
Brands
are
increasingly
allocating
substantial
portions
of
their
marketing
budgets
to
social
media
campaigns,
seeking
to
capitalise
on
the
authenticity
and
relatability
that
influencers
can
provide.
The
media
industry
has
also
been
revolutionised
by
social
media
influence.
Traditional
forms
of
media
consumption
are
being
overshadowed
by
content
consumption
through
social
platforms.
The
Reuters
Institute
for
the
Study
of
Journalism
reports
that
more
than
half
of
the
global
population
now
uses
social
media
to
access
news,
making
it
a
critical
platform
for
media
companies
to
engage
with
their
audience.
Furthermore,
the
impact
of
social
media
on
Kids
and
Youth
is
particularly
significant.
This
demographic,
often
called
‚Äòdigital
natives,‚Äô
is
highly
influenced
by
social
media
trends
and
influencers.
A

The
implications
for
industries
targeting
this
age
group
are
profound,
necessitating
a
strong
and
authentic
social
media
presence
to
capture
this
market
segment
effectively.
With
its
far-reaching
implications,
the
trend
of
social
media
influence
is
reshaping
how
brands
approach
marketing
and
consumer
engagement.
As
we
approach
2024,
it
is
evident
that
industries
like
Advertising,

Telecommunications
companies
are
thus
focusing
on
expanding
their

infrastructure
and
offering
more
competitive
home
internet

E-commerce
has
seen
a
significant
uptick
in
this
era
of
home-centricity.
Online
shopping,
already
on
the
rise,
has
been
further
accelerated
by
the

innovate
at
a
rapid
pace.
These
advancements
significantly
impact
various
industries,
including
B2B,
CPG,
and
financial
services,
redefining
how
businesses

say
the
experience
a
company
provides
is
as
important
as
its

These
technologies
allow
consumers
to
visualise
products
in
a
real-world
context
before
purchasing,
greatly
enhancing
the
online
shopping
experience.
This
is
particularly
transformative
for
the
CPG

rapid
evolution
in
e-commerce.
The
emergence
of
blockchain
and
cryptocurrency,
along
with
more
established
digital
wallets
and
payment
platforms,
is
creating
a
more
diverse
and
secure
financial
ecosystem.

with
73%
of
global
consumers
saying
they
would
definitely
or

e-commerce
innovation
continues
to
shape
the
landscape
of
B2B
transactions,
redefine
consumer
experiences
in
the
CPG
sector,
and

in
the
retail
sector
was
$2.01
million
in
2023.
This
has
prompted
e-commerce
companies
to
adopt
more
robust
data
protection
protocols,
like
enhanced
encryption
and
secure
payment
gateways,
to
safeguard
customer
information
and
maintain
trust.
The
technology
sector
is
at
the
forefront
of
addressing
privacy
and
data
security
concerns.
As
technology
advances,
so
do
the
complexities
of
data
protection.
Tech
companies
continuously
innovate
to
provide
solutions
that
ensure
data
integrity
and
confidentiality.
The
rise
of
privacy-focused
technologies
like
blockchain
and
advanced
encryption
methods
are
testaments
to
this
trend.
Consumer
awareness
around
data
privacy
is
also
rising.
This
has
led
to
a
demand
for
more
transparency
and
control
over
personal
information,
prompting
companies
across
these
sectors
to
adopt
privacy-by-design
principles
in
their
operations.
Looking
ahead
to
2024
and
beyond,
privacy
and
data
security
will
continue
to
be
critical.
As
digitalisation
deepens,
brands
must
stay
ahead
of
evolving
cybersecurity
threats
and
continuously
build
consumer
trust
through
robust
data
protection
practices.
This
trend
is
not
just
a
regulatory
requirement;
it‚Äôs
a
strategic
imperative
in
a
world
where
data
is
the
new
currency.
Trend
14:
Experience
over
Ownership
The
shift
towards
valuing
experiences
over
ownership
marks
a
significant
change
in
consumer
behaviour.
This
trend
reflects
a
deeper
desire
for
meaningful
and
memorable
engagements
rather
than
material
possessions.
In
the
auto
sector,
the
rise
of
car-sharing
and
subscription
services
exemplifies
this
trend.
Consumers
are
increasingly
opting
for
access
to
a
vehicle
rather
than
owning
one.
This
shift
is
driven
by
urbanisation,
environmental
concerns,
and
a
growing
preference
for
access
over
ownership,
especially
among
younger
consumers.
The
food
and
beverage
industry
is
also
witnessing
this
transformation.
Consumers
are
seeking
unique
dining
experiences
that
offer
more
than
just
food.
According
to
a
study
by
Eventbrite,
75%
of
millennials
would
rather
spend
money
on
a
desirable
experience
or
event
over
buying
something
desirable.
This
has
led
to
a
surge
in
experiential
dining
concepts,
food
festivals,
and
culinary
tourism.
Restaurants
and
food
brands
are
innovating
to
provide
immersive
experiences,
from
themed
dining
to
interactive
culinary
workshops.
In
the
media
sector,
the
focus
has
shifted
from
owning
physical
media
to
accessing
a
wide
range
of
content
through
streaming
services.
The
global
video
streaming
market
was
valued
at
$146.6
billion
and
is
expected
to
grow
8.86
percent
through
2028.
This
growth
is
fueled
by
consumers‚Äô
desire
for
diverse,
on-demand
content
that
provides
an
experience.
This
trend
towards
experience
over
ownership
is
driven
by
various
factors,
including
the
rise
of
the
digital
economy,
environmental
awareness,
and
changing
lifestyle
preferences.
As
consumers
seek
richer
experiences
and
connections,
industries
must
adapt
by
creating
offerings
that
are
not
just
products
or
services
but
memorable
experiences
that
resonate
on
a
deeper
emotional
level.
In
2024
and
beyond,
the
experience
economy
will
continue
to
thrive.
Automotive
companies
will
innovate
with
flexible
usage
models,
food
and
beverage
businesses
will
craft
unique
experiential
offerings,
and
media
companies
will
enhance
content
delivery
to
provide
immersive
experiences.
This
trend
signifies
a
profound
shift
in
consumer
values,
emphasising
the
importance
of
experiences
in
shaping
our
lives
and
choices.
Trend
15:
Localism
Localism,
the
increasing
preference
for
locally
sourced
and
produced
goods,
is
a
trend
that
has
seen
significant
growth
and
is
particularly
influential
in
the
agriculture,
food
and
beverage,
and
CPG
industries.
This
shift
reflects
a
broader
consumer
awareness
and
preference
for
sustainability,
community
support,
and
product
traceability.
In
the
agriculture
sector,
the
demand
for
local
produce
has
surged.
According
to
a
survey
by
the
National
Farmers
Union,
68%
of
consumers
prefer
to
buy
produce
that
has
been
grown
locally.
This
trend
is
driven
by
a
desire
for
fresh,
high-quality
products
and
a
growing
concern
about
the
environmental
impact
of
long-distance
food
transportation.
Farmers‚Äô
markets
and
community-supported
agriculture
(CSA)
programs
have
become
increasingly
popular,
providing
direct
channels
for
consumers
to
access
local
produce.
The
food
and
beverage
industry
has
also
witnessed
a
significant
impact.
A
report
by
the
Food
Marketing
Institute
showed
that
55%
of
consumers
are
willing
to
pay
more
for
products
sourced
from
their
local
area.
Restaurants
and
food
retailers
are
increasingly
highlighting
local
ingredients
in
their
offerings,
catering
to
the
growing
consumer
interest
in
the
origin
of
their
food.
This
localism
trend
has
led
to
the
rise
of
farm-to-table
restaurants
and
local
craft
breweries,
emphasising
the
connection
between
the
consumer,
their
food,
and
the
local
community.
There
is
a
notable
shift
towards
local
brands
and
products
in
the
Consumer
Packaged
Goods
sector.
A
study
revealed
that
local
brands
are
growing
faster
than
global
ones,
with
a
50%
increase
in
consumer
preference
for
local
over
global
products.
Consumers
seek
products
with
local
ingredients,
production,
and
heritage,
viewing
them
as
more
authentic
and
trustworthy.
Localism
as
a
trend
is
driven
by
a
combination
of
factors:
a
desire
for
transparency
in
product
sourcing,
support
for
local
economies,
environmental
concerns,
and
a
search
for
authenticity.
In
2024
and
beyond,
this
trend
will
continue
to
shape
consumer
choices
and
strategies.
Businesses
aligning
with
this
trend
by
sourcing
locally,
highlighting
local
heritage,
and
fostering
community
connections
will
likely
see
increased
consumer
loyalty
and
preference.
Localism
reflects
a
consumer
trend
and
embodies
a
broader
societal
shift
towards
sustainability
and
community-focused
living.
Final
Thoughts
As
we
have
explored
in
this
comprehensive
analysis,
the
15
consumer
trends
highlighted
are
not
mere
fleeting
phenomena
but
represent
significant
shifts
in
the
consumer
landscape.
These
trends,
from
sustainable
practices
to
digital
experiences
and
localism,
underscore
a
dynamic
and
evolving
marketplace.
Understanding
and
adapting
to
these
trends
is
crucial
for
brands
aiming
to
remain
relevant
and
successful
in
the
ever-changing
business
environment.
The
key
takeaway
for
brands
is
the
importance
of
agility
and
responsiveness.
In
a
world
where
consumer
preferences
and
behaviours
continuously
evolve,
brands
must
quickly
adapt,
innovating
and
reevaluating
their
strategies
to
align
with
these
trends.
Whether
embracing
sustainable
practices,
personalising
offerings,
or
engaging
with
smart
technologies,
each
trend
presents
unique
opportunities
for
brands
to
connect
with
their
audience
meaningfully.
Another
critical
aspect
is
the
need
for
authenticity
and
transparency
in
all
brand
actions.
As
consumers
become
more
informed
and
concerned
about
issues
like
sustainability,
data
privacy,
and
ethical
practices,
brands
that
demonstrate
genuine
commitment
and
transparency
in
these
areas
will
likely
gain
consumer
trust
and
loyalty.
Furthermore,
integrating
technology
and
digital
strategies
is
no
longer
optional
but
a
necessity.
Technology
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
addressing
and
capitalising
on
these
trends,
from
enhancing
customer
experiences
through
augmented
realities
to
leveraging
data
for
personalised
marketing.
In
conclusion,
the
15
consumer
trends
of
2024
present
a
roadmap
for
brands
to
navigate
the
future
market
landscape.
By
embracing
these
trends,
brands
can
stay
ahead
of
the
curve
and
forge
deeper,
more
meaningful
connections
with
their
consumers.
The
future
belongs
to
those
who
are
prepared
to
innovate,
adapt,
and
resonate
with
their

Helping
brands
uncover
valuable
insights
We‚Äôve
been
working
with
Kadence
on
a
couple
of
strategic
projects,
which
influenced
our
product
roadmap
roll-out
within
the
region.
Their
work
has
been
exceptional
in
providing
me
the
insights
that
I
need.
Kadence‚Äôs
reports
give
us
the
insight,
conclusion
and
recommended
execution
needed
to
give
us
a
different
perspective,
which
provided
us
with
an
opportunity
to
relook
at
our
go
to
market
strategy
in
a
different
direction
which
we
are
now
reaping
the
benefits
from.
Kadence
helped
us
not
only
conduct
a
thorough
and
insightful
piece
of
research,
its
interpretation
of
the
data
provided
many
useful
and
unexpected
good-news
stories
that
we
were
able
to
use
in
our
communications
and
interactions
with
government
bodies.
Kadence
team
is
more
like
a
partner
to
us.
We
have
run
a
number
of
projects
together
and
‚Ä¶
the
pro-activeness,
out
of
the
box
thinking
and

of
tight
deadlines
are
some
of
the
key
reasons
we
always
reach

to
them.
Kadence
were
an
excellent
partner
on
this
project;
they
took
time
to
really
understand
our
business
challenges,
and
developed
a
research

that
would
tackle
the
exam
question
from
all
directions.
The
impact
of
the
work
is
still
being
felt
now,
several
years
later.
