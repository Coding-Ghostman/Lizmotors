NOTE
REGARDING
FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS\nThis
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K,
including,
without
limitation,
statements
under
the
heading
“Management’s
Discussion
and
Analysis
of
Financial
Condition
and\nResults
of
Operations,”
contains
forward-looking
statements
within
the
meaning
of
Section
27A
of
the
Securities
Act
of
1933,
as
amended,
or
the
Securities
Act,
and
Section
21E
of\nthe
Securities
Exchange
Act
of
1934,
as
amended,
or
the
Exchange
Act.
We
have
based
these
forward-looking
statements
on
our
current
expectations
and
projections
about
future\nevents.
All
statements,
other
than
statements
of
present
or
historical
fact
included
in
this
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K
are
forward-looking
statements.
In
some
cases,
you
can\nidentify
forward-looking
statements
by
terminology
such
as
“anticipate,”
“believe,”
“continue,”
“could,”
“estimate,”
“expect,”
“intends,”
“may,”
“might,”
“plan,”
“possible,”\n“potential,”
“predict,”
“project,”
“should,”
“will,”
“would”
or
the
negative
of
such
terms
or
other
similar
expressions.
These
forward-looking
statements
are
subject
to
known
and\nunknown
risks,
uncertainties
and
assumptions
about
us
that
may
cause
our
actual
results,
levels
of
activity,
performance
or
achievements
to
be
materially
different
from
any
future\nresults,
levels
of
activity,
performance
or
achievements
expressed
or
implied
by
such
forward-looking
statements.\nThese
statements
are
subject
to
known
and
unknown
risks,
uncertainties
and
assumptions,
many
of
which
are
difficult
to
predict
and
are
beyond
our
control
and
could\ncause
actual
results
to
differ
materially
from
those
projected
or
otherwise
implied
by
the
forward-looking
statements.
Below
is
a
summary
of
certain
material
factors
that
may
make\nan
investment
in
our
common
stock
speculative
or
risky.\n•\nWe
are
an
early
stage
company
with
a
history
of
losses
and
expect
to
incur
significant
expenses
and
continuing
losses
for
the
foreseeable
future.\n•\nWe
may
be
unable
to
adequately
control
the
costs
associated
with
our
operations.\n•\nOur
current
business
plans
require
a
significant
amount
of
capital.
If
we
are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
funding
or
do
not
have
access
to
capital,
we
will
be
unable
to\nexecute
our
business
plans
and
our
prospects,
financial
condition
and
results
of
operations
could
be
materially
adversely
affected.\n•\nOur
management
has
performed
an
analysis
of
our
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
and
has
identified
substantial
doubt
about
our
ability
to
continue
as
a
going\nconcern.
If
we
are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
additional
funding
or
do
not
have
access
to
additional
capital,
we
will
be
unable
to
execute
our
business
plans
and
could
be\nrequired
to
terminate
or
significantly
curtail
our
operations.\n•\nWe
have
been
notified
by
The
Nasdaq
Stock
Market
LLC
of
our
failure
to
comply
with
certain
continued
listing
requirements
and,
if
we
are
unable
to
regain\ncompliance
with
all
applicable
continued
listing
requirements
and
standards
of
Nasdaq,
our
Common
Stock
could
be
delisted
from
Nasdaq,
which
would
have
an\nadverse
impact
on
the
trading,
liquidity,
and
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock.\n•\nAdverse
developments
affecting
the
financial
services
industry,
such
as
actual
events
or
concerns
involving
liquidity,
defaults
or
non-performance
by
financial\ninstitutions
could
adversely
affect
our
current
financial
condition
and
projected
business
operations.\n•\nWe
have
not
achieved
positive
operating
cash
flow
and,
given
our
projected
funding
needs,
our
ability
to
generate
positive
cash
flow
is
uncertain.\n•\nOur
financial
results
may
vary
significantly
from
period
to
period
due
to
fluctuations
in
our
operating
costs,
product
demand
and
other
factors.\n•\nOur
limited
operating
history
makes
evaluating
our
business
and
future
prospects
difficult
and
increases
the
risk
of
your
investment.\n•\nWe
previously
identified
material
weaknesses
in
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting.
Although
the
weaknesses
previously
identified
have
been
remediated,
if\nwe
identify
additional
material
weaknesses
in
the
future
or
otherwise
fail
to
maintain
an
effective
system
of
internal
controls,
we
may
not
be
able
to
accurately\n3\n',

timely
report
our
financial
condition
or
results
of
operations,
which
may
adversely
affect
our
business
and
stock
price.\n•\nIf
we
fail
to
manage
our
growth
effectively,
we
may
not
be
able
to
design,
develop,
manufacture,
market
and
launch
our
EVs
successfully.\n•\nWe
are
highly
dependent
on
the
services
of
our
key
employees
and
senior
management
and,
if
we
are
unable
to
attract
and
retain
key
employees
and
hire
qualified\nmanagement,
technical
and
EV
engineering
personnel,
our
ability
to
compete
could
be
harmed.\n•\nWe
face
significant
barriers
to
manufacture
and
bring
our
EVs
to
market,
and
if
we
cannot
successfully
overcome
those
barriers
our
business
will
be
negatively\nimpacted.\n•\nCustomers
who
have
committed
to
purchase
significant
amounts
of
our
vehicles
may
purchase
significantly
fewer
vehicles
than
we
currently
anticipate
or
none
at
all.
In\nthat
case,
we
will
not
realize
the
revenue
we
expect
from
these
customers.\n•\nOur
ability
to
develop
and
manufacture
EVs
of
sufficient
quality
and
appeal
to
customers
on
schedule
and
on
a
large
scale
is
unproven
and
still
evolving.\n•\nWe
will
depend
initially
on
revenue
generated
from
a
single
EV
model
and
in
the
foreseeable
future
will
be
significantly
dependent
on
a
limited
number
of
models.\n•\nThere
is
no
guarantee
that
we
will
be
able
to
develop
our
software
platform,
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
or
that
if
we
are
able
to
develop
it,
that
we
will
obtain
the
revenue\nand
other
benefits
we
expect
from
it.\n•\nWe
may
fail
to
attract
new
customers
in
sufficient
numbers
or
at
sufficient
rates
or
at
all
or
to
retain
existing
customers.\n•\nIf
our
EVs
fail
to
perform
as
expected,
our
ability
to
develop,
market
and
deploy
our
EVs
could
be
harmed.\n•\nOur
distribution
model
may
expose
us
to
risk
and
if
unsuccessful
may
impact
our
business
prospects
and
results
of
operations.\n•\nWe
face
legal,
regulatory
and
legislative
uncertainty
in
how
our
go-to-market
models
will
be
interpreted
under
existing
and
future
law,
including
the
potential
inability\nto
protect
our
intellectual
property
rights,
and
we
may
be
required
to
adjust
our
consumer
business
model
in
certain
jurisdictions
as
a
result.\n•\nIf
we
fail
to
successfully
build
and
tool
our
manufacturing
facilities
or
if
our
manufacturing
facilities
become
inoperable,
we
will
be
unable
to
produce
our
vehicles
and\nour
business
will
be
harmed.\n•\nWe
may
not
be
able
to
realize
the
non-dilutive
financial
incentives
offered
by
the
States
of
Oklahoma
and
Arkansas
where
we
will
develop
our
own
manufacturing\nfacilities.\n•\nDeveloping
our
own
manufacturing
facilities
for
production
of
our
EVs
could
increase
our
capital
expenditures
and
delay
or
inhibit
production
of
our
EVs.\n•\nWe
have
no
experience
to
date
in
high
volume
manufacture
of
our
EVs.\n•\nWe
may
experience
significant
delays
in
the
design,
production
and
launch
of
our
EVs,
which
could
harm
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating\nresults.\n•\nIncreases
in
costs,
disruption
of
supply
or
shortage
of
raw
materials
and
other
components
used
in
our
vehicles,
in
particular
lithium-ion
battery
cells,
could
harm
our\nbusiness.
\n•\nWe
depend
upon
third
parties
to
manufacture
and
to
supply
key
components
and
services
necessary
for
our
vehicles.
We
do
not
have
long-term
agreements
with
all
of\nour
manufacturers
and
suppliers,
and
if
these
manufacturers
or
suppliers
become
unwilling

BUSINESS\nCompany
Overview\nCanoo
is
a
high
tech
advanced
mobility
technology
company
with
a
mission
to
bring
electric
vehicles
(“EVs”)
to
everyone
and
provide
connected
services
that
improve\nthe
fleet
or
individual
vehicle
ownership
experience.
We
are
developing
a
technology
platform
that
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
rapidly
innovate,
iterate
and
bring
new
products,\naddressing
multiple
use
cases,
to
market
faster
than
our
competition
and
at
lower
cost.
Our
vehicle
architecture
and
design
philosophy
are
aimed
at
driving
productivity
and\nreturning
capital
to
our
customers,
and
we
believe
the
software
and
technology
capabilities
we
are
developing,
packaged
around
a
modular,
customizable
product,
have
the
potential\nto
empower
the
customer
experience
across
a
vehicle’s
lifecycle.
We
remain
committed
to
the
environment
and
to
delivering
sustainable
mobility
that
is
accessible
to
everyone.
We\nproudly
intend
to
manufacture
our
fully
electric
vehicles
in
Oklahoma,
bringing
advanced
manufacturing
and
technology
jobs
to
communities
in
America's
heartland.
We
are\ncommitted
to
building
a
diverse
workforce
that
will
draw
heavily
upon
the
local
communities
of
Native
Americans
and
veterans.\nWe
believe
we
are
one
of
the
first
automotive
manufacturers
focused
on
monetizing
value
across
the
entirety
of
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.
Our
platform\nand
data
architecture
is
purpose-built
to
be
durable
and
serve
as
the
foundation
for
the
vehicles
we
intend
to
offer,
unlocking
a
highly
differentiated,
multi-layer
business
model.
The\nfoundational
layer
is
our
Multi-Purpose
Platform
(“MPP”
or
“platform”)
architecture,
which
serves
as
the
base
of
our
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
its
Delivery,\nBase,
Premium,
and
Adventure
trims;
the
Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicle
(“MPDV”)
and
the
Pickup.
The
next
layer
is
cybersecurity
which
is
embedded
in
our
vehicle
to
ensure\nthe
privacy
and
protection
of
vehicle
data.
Our
top
hats,
or
cabins,
are
modular
and
purpose-built
to
provide
tailored
solutions
for
our
customers.
This
intentional
design
enables
us\nto
efficiently
use
resources
to
produce
only
what
is
necessary,
underscoring
our
focus
on
sustainability
and
returning
capital
to
customers.
The
remaining
layers,
connected\naccessories
and
digital
customer
ecosystem,
present
high-margin
opportunities
that
extend
beyond
the
initial
vehicle
sale,
across
multiple
owners.
Owners
will
further
be
able
to\ncustomize
their
vehicles
by
adding
connected
accessories
such
as
Bluetooth
devices
or
infotainment
systems.
In
addition,
there
are
opportunities
for
software
sales
throughout
the\nvehicle
life,
including
predictive
maintenance
and
service
software
or
advanced
driver
assistance
systems
(“ADAS”)
upgrades.\nOur
platform
architecture
is
a
self-contained,
fully
functional
rolling
chassis
that
directly
houses
the
most
critical
components
for
operation
of
an
EV,
including
our
in-\nhouse
designed
proprietary
electric
drivetrain,
battery
systems,
advanced
vehicle
control
electronics
and
software
and
other
critical
components,
which
all
have
been
optimized
for\nfunctional
integration.
Both
our
true
steer-by-wire
system,
believed
to
be
the
first
such
system
applied
to
a
production-intent
vehicle,
and
our
transverse
composite
leaf-spring\nsuspension
system
are
core
components
of
our
platform’s
differentiated
functionality,
enabling
the
development
of
a
broad
range
of
vehicle
types
and
use
cases
due
to
the
chassis’\nflat
profile
and
fully
variable
steering
positions.
All
of
our
announced
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle,
the
MPDV
and
the
Pickup,
will\nshare
a
common
platform
architecture
paired
with
different
top
hats
to
create
a
range
of
uniquely
customized
and
use
case
optimized
purpose-built
mobility
solutions
targeting\nmultiple
segments
of
the
rapidly
expanding
EV
marketplace.\nIn
addition
to
our
vehicle
technology,
we
are
developing
an
in-house
designed
and
proprietary
software
platform
that
aggregates
car
data
from
both
Canoo
and
non-Canoo\nvehicles
and
delivers
valuable
insights
to
our
customers.
Collected
over-the-air
for
connected
vehicles
or
via
an
on-board
diagnostics
(“OBD”)
device
for
non-connected
vehicles,\nwe
believe
car
data
is
critical
to
powering
the
customer
journey
and
maximizing
utility
and
value
from
the
vehicle
ownership
experience.
Leveraging
our
data
aggregation
platform,\nwe
aim
to
create
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
an
application
store
that
centralizes
all
vehicle
information
for
customers
and
provides
key
tools
across
Security
&
Safety,\nHousehold
Vehicle
Management,
Fleet
Management,
Lifecycle
Management
and
Vehicle
Asset
Management.
Through
our
software
offering,
we
believe
we
can
provide
substantial\nvalue
to
both
commercial
customers
and
consumers
by
staying
connected
throughout
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.\nCore
to
our
values
is
delivering
high
quality
products
while
empowering
local
communities,
which
drove
our
decision
to
build
in
America
and
source
a
majority
of
our\nparts
from
America
and
allied
nations.
We
believe
vertical
integration
across
our
manufacturing
and
assembly
process
will
enable
us
to
achieve
in-house
scale
production
with
less\nsupply
chain
risk
and
provide
us
better
oversight
of
our
vehicle
manufacturing.
We
are
building
production
facilities
in
states
and
communities
that
are
investing
in
high-tech\nmanufacturing
alongside
us,
creating
American
jobs
and
driving
innovation.\n6\n"",

has
set
the
foundation
for
us
to
develop
into
a
scalable
business
that
is
differentiated
from
our
peers\nacross
the
automotive
original
equipment
manufacturer
(“OEM”)
landscape.\nOur
Foundational
Chassis
and
Purpose-Built
Vehicles\nOur
Multi-Purpose
Platform\nTechnology
first,
we
view
our
vehicles
as
hardware
and
software
solutions
and
look
at
our
business
as
a
technology
equipment
manufacturer
(TEM).
We
have
designed\nwhat
we
believe
to
be
the
world’s
most
modular,
flattest,
production-ready
EV
platform.
It
is
purposefully
engineered
to
provide
maximum
consumer
and
cargo
space
on
a
small\nvehicle
footprint.
The
platform’s
modularity
supports
a
wide
range
of
vehicle
applications
and
use
cases.
With
our
common
platform
architecture,
we
expect
to
enable
the\nproduction
of
our
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle,
MPDV,
and
Pickup,
among
other
additional
vehicle
variants.
By
using
a
uniquely
versatile
platform\narchitecture
strategy
as
the
foundation
for
multiple
vehicles,
we
expect
to
reduce
both
time
and
expense
in
research
and
development,
testing
and
manufacturing.
These
efficiencies\nenable
us
to
develop
and
scale
future
vehicle
programs
faster
and
at
a
significantly
lower
overall
cost
than
other
vehicle
manufacturers.
In
addition,
by
allowing
us
to
develop
and\nbring
new
products
to
market,
our
platform
architecture
will
enable
us
to
more
efficiently
allocate
capital
to
meet
current
and
evolving
areas
of
demand
and
market
opportunities.\n
\nOur
proprietary
platform
architecture
directly
houses
all
of
the
most
critical
components
of
an
EV.
This
includes
the
market’s
first
true
steer-by-wire
platform,
a
composite\nleaf
spring
suspension
system,
an
advanced
fully
electric
drivetrain,
a
modular
battery
and
battery
management
systems,
“DC
fast
charge”
and
bi-directional
charging
capabilities,\nand
an
innovative
electrical
systems
architecture.
Each
of
these
component
systems
has
been
engineered
not
only
for
optimal
performance
but
also
for
efficient
packaging
into
our\ncompact
platform.
We
place
a
strong
emphasis
on
efficiency
and
functional
integration,
and
have
designed
many

to
fulfill
as
many
functions
as
possible.

Strategy\nManufacturing\nOur
objective
is
to
maximize
return
on
capital
by
matching
our
cost
structure
with
our
projected
production
while
meeting
timing
and
quality
expectations.
We
have\ncarefully
assessed
various
manufacturing
footprint
options
and
have
concluded
that
building
in
America
is
best
aligned
with
our
mission
and
current
focus
to
invest
in
the\ncommunities
and
states
that
are
investing
in
high-tech,
innovative
manufacturing
alongside
us,
creating
American
jobs.
In
addition,
we
are
exploring
the
use
of
advanced\nmanufacturing
techniques
including
additive
manufacturing,
laser
welding,
and
flexible
factory
machinery
and
equipment,
which
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
efficiently\nmanufacture
top
hats
serving
multiple
use
cases.
This
will
allow
us
to
more
effectively
allocate
capital
to
respond
to
market
demand.
We
plan
to
produce
the
Lifestyle
Delivery\nVehicle
in
2023,
preceding
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle,
Pickup
and
Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicle,
which
all
sits
on
our
Multi-Purpose

we
have
secured
commitments
with
the
states
of
Oklahoma
and
Arkansas
for
manufacturing,
R&D,
software
development
and
customer
support
and
finance\nfacilities.
We
are
in
the
process
of
completing
definitive
agreements
with
both
states
including
approximately
$440
million
of
non-dilutive
financial
incentives.
We
leveraged
slow\nbuilds
with
our
contract
manufacturing
partner
to
validate
and
test
our
processes
in
advance
of
starting
high-volume
scaled
production
in
Oklahoma.\nIn
addition,
we
are
focused
on

In
designing
our

we
have
conducted
thousands
of
computer-aided

to
define

and
optimize
the
structural
design
of
our\nvehicles
quickly
and
at

processes.\nWe
believe
the
results
of
our
physical

have
validated
the
accuracy
and
utility
of
our
predictive
CAE
crash

and
our\noverall
more
efficient,
digitized
approach
to

we
believe
the
crash

conducted
on
our

will
also
aid
us
in
more
rapidly
bringing
our
future
vehicle
models
to
market,
as
the
majority
of
research\nand
development
and
a
significant
portion
of
crash
structure
is
integrated
into
the
platform
design.
We
believe
this
provides
a
critical
advantage
over
our
competitors
in
terms
of\nrequired
capital
deployment
and
program
development
timing.\nSales

revenue
throughout
the
vehicle
lifecycle:
Today,
OEMs
are
primarily
focused
on
selling
vehicles
to
their
first
owner,
leaving\nsignificant
opportunity
behind
in
the
aftermarket.
We
estimate

automotive
service-related\nsoftware
offerings
and
over-the-air

With
this
approach,
we
have
innovated

the
traditional
OEM

and
positioned
ourselves
to
capture\nmore
value.\n•\nHighly

cases
and
applications.
Our
current
platform
architecture
can
support
multiple
vehicles,
addressing
different
segments
of
the
vehicle
market.
Additionally,
our\nvehicle
design
and
engineering
is
functionality-focused,
differentiated
by
its
simplicity
and
intended
superior
performance.
For
example,
our
drive
unit
has
less
than
10%
of\nthe
parts
an
average
vehicle
with
an
internal
combustion
engine
would
have.
All
of
these
key
innovations
are
protected
intellectual
IP,
such
as
our
drive-by-wire
packaging,\nsuspension
and
battery
pack
thermal
management,
differentiating
us
from
our
peers.\n•\nSoftware
centric
ecosystem
built
upon
access
to
harmonized
vehicle
data
enabling
monetization
opportunities:
We
believe
our
software
and
its
vehicle
agnostic\napproach
is
a
critical
differentiator
relative
to
our
peers.
By
harnessing
vehicle
data
across
both
Canoo
and
other
vehicles,
we
position
ourselves
to
become
the
vehicle
asset\nmanagement
platform
of
entire
households
or
fleets.
Our
software
platform
is
designed
to
aggregate
and
anonymize
vehicle
data
such
as
motor
temperature,
diagnostic\nstatus,
and
tire
pressure
either
over-the-air
from
Canoo
and
other
connected
vehicles,
or
via
an
OBD
device
for
legacy
vehicles.
We
expect
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem
will\nbe
built
upon
this
harmonized
vehicle
data,
which
will
be
analyzed
to
deliver
insights
to
customers
about
all
their
vehicles
in
one
centralized
location.
As
a
part
of
the
Canoo\nDigital
Ecosystem,
we
intend
to
ultimately
build
a
robust
ecosystem
of
partner
solutions
including
fleet
logistics,
insurance,
charging
stations,
and
body
and
repair
shops,
to\ndeepen
our
value
proposition
to
customers
while
driving
business
for
our
partners.\nMost
importantly,
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem
is
intended
to
enable
us
to
maintain
connectivity
to
our
customers
throughout
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
regardless
of
whether\nthey
are
the
1st,
2nd,
3rd
or
4th
vehicle
owner.
By
capturing
all
the
potential
touchpoints
throughout
a
vehicle’s
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners,
we
can
better
understand\nour
customers,
enabling
us
to
continue
building
the
most
utilitarian,
innovative
solutions
to
address
their
needs.\n•\nExperienced
leadership
with
a
long
track
record
of
success
and
deep
expertise
in
automotive

modular
accessories,
hardware,
software
products,
and
variants
while
continuing
to
invest
in
our
proprietary
technology
platform.\nThe
key
elements
to
our
growth
strategy
include:\n•\nIntroducing
Next-Generation
Models
and
Variants:
By
leveraging
our
modular
platform,
we
anticipate
that
new
vehicle
models
and
variants
can
be
developed
more\nquickly
than
traditional
models.
The
new
models
and
variants
provide
flexibility
with
launching
new
use
cases,
price
alternatives
and
geographies.\n•\nBringing
Non-Canoo
Vehicles
into
our
Ecosystem:
Our
software
ecosystem
is
intended
to
incorporate
vehicles
produced
by
us
as
well
as
those
from
other
manufacturers.\nThis
will
increase
the
number
of
vehicles
our
products
have
access
to,
and
the
monetizable
services
we
offer
our
customers.
We
aim
to
offer
customers
the
full
suite
of\nservices
in
all
of
their
cars
resulting
in
an
opportunity
to
generate
additional
revenue
streams.\n•\nGrowing
Market
Share
and
Expanding
Internationally:
We
believe
our
unique
modular
design,
proprietary
software
ecosystem,
customizable
customer
experience
and\nvehicle
technology
will
allow
us
to
gain
market
share
domestically.
As
we
grow,
we
may
expand
internationally
increasing
our
total
addressable
market.
Our
standard\nmodular
platform
will
drive
efficiency
in
homologation
in
new
markets.
The
platform’s
size
is
also
well
suited
for
international
markets.\n•\nIncreasing
Penetration
of
our
Digital
Ecosystem:
Over
time
we
anticipate
that
we
will
be
able
to
capture
a
higher
percentage
of
the
50-70
customer
transactions
over
a\nvehicle’s
lifecycle
as
we
develop
additional
software
capabilities.
As
we
grow
our
network
of
customers,
we
will
continue
to
invest
in
and
enhance
our
software
ecosystem\nby
adding
additional
vehicle
options
and
services
through
partnerships.\nINTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY\nOur
ability
to
protect
our
material
intellectual
property
is
important
to
our
business.
We
rely
upon
a
combination
of
protections
afforded
to
owners
of
patents,
copyrights,\ntrade
secrets,
and
trademarks,
along
with
employee
and
third-party
non-disclosure
agreements
and
other
contractual
restrictions
to
establish
and
protect
our
intellectual
property\nrights.
In
particular,
unpatented
trade
secrets
in
the
fields
of
research,
development
and
engineering
are
an
important
aspect
of
our
business,
ensuring
that
our
technology
remains\nconfidential.
We
also
pursue
patent
protection
when
we
believe
we
have
developed
a
patentable
invention
and
the
benefits
of
obtaining
a
patent
outweigh
the
risks
of
making
the\ninvention
public
through
patent
filings.\nAs
of
December
31,
2022,
we
had
114
pending
or
allowed
U.S.
patents
and
106
pending
or
allowed
international
patent
applications.
Our
patents
and
patent
applications\nare
related
to,
among
other
things,
EV
platforms,
powertrain
technologies,
suspension
systems,
battery
systems,
drive-by-wire
design,
impact
features,
manufacturing
methods
and\nvehicle
and
product
design.
We
pursue
the
registration
of
our
domain
names
and
material
trademarks
and
service
marks
in
the
United
States
and
in
some
locations
abroad.
In
an\neffort
to
protect
our
brand,
as
of
December
31,
2022,
we
had
one
U.S.
registered
trademark,
one
pending
U.S.
trademark
application,
and
67
registered
or
pending
international\ntrademarks.\nWe
regularly
review
our
development
efforts
to
assess
the
existence
and
patentability
of
new
inventions,
and
we
file
additional
patent
applications
when
it
is
determined
it\nwould
benefit
our
business
to
do
so.\nEMPLOYEES
AND
HUMAN
CAPITAL\nAs
an
organization,
we
pride
ourselves
on
attracting
and
developing
a
skilled
workforce
drawing
from
deep
automotive
and
technology
experience.
As
of
December
31,\n2022,
we
had
812
employees.
Approximately
75%
of
our
workforce
is
engaged
in
research
and
development,
manufacturing
and
related
engineering
and
testing
functions.\nWe
maintain
a
robust
compensation
and
benefits
program
to
attract,
retain,
incentivize
and
reward
the
talented
employees
who
contribute
to
our
business
and
who
share
in\nour
vision
to
create
a
cleaner
planet
and
bring
EVs
to
everyone.
In
addition
to
a
competitive

salary,
our
compensation
and
benefits
program
includes
heavily
subsidized\nhealthcare
and
insurance
benefits,
health
savings
accounts,
equity-based
compensation
awards,
401(k),
flexible
paid
time
off
and
paid
family
leave.
We
provide
our
employees
and\ntheir
families
with
access
to
a
variety
of
flexible
and
convenient
health
programs
that
allow
employees
to
customize
their
benefits
to
best
meet
the
needs
of
their
individual
families.\nWe
provide
an

for
employees
to
increase
their

and
investment
in
the
company.
We
also
provide

attention
to
the
continued
development
of

We\ncontinue
ramping
up
additional
hiring
efforts
across
our
organization
as
we
develop
our
announced
vehicle
programs
and
software
offerings,
expand
our
geographic
footprint
and,\nin
particular,
as
we
ready
and
ramp
our
manufacturing
facilities
in
Oklahoma
and
support
of
announced
vehicle
and
software
programs.
We
accelerated
hiring
in
the
first
half
of\n2022
as
we
build
our
facilities
and
staff
up
for
production.
As
part
of
our
growth
and
retention
strategy,
we
identify
and
recruit
in
particular
from
well-respected
OEMs,
tier
one\nautomotive
suppliers,
automotive
engineering
firms,
software
enterprises
and
high-growth
technology
companies,
while
also
incentivizing
talent
development
within
our
existing\norganization.
As
we
transfer
key
operations
to
the
States
of
Oklahoma
and
Arkansas,
we
are
partnering
with
local
agencies
to
attract
residents
of
those
states,
which
include
a\nsignificant
native
American
and
veteran
population.
We
are
committed
to
attracting
and
retaining
a
workforce
which
is
ethnically,
racially
and
gender
diverse,
and
we
integrate\ndiversity,
equity
and
inclusion
principles
and
practices
into
our
corporate
recruiting,
onboarding
and
long-term
retention
strategies.\nWe
are
invested
in
seeing
that
our
corporate
values
are
reflected
in
all
aspects
of
our
operations
and
decision-making,
and
that
our
policies
and
practices
reflect
our\ncommitment
to
fostering
high
ethical
standards
across
our
entire
organization.
We
promote
a
safe
work
environment
by
conducting
annual
anti-harassment
training
for
management\nand
employees
alike.
Any
employee
with
concerns
related
to
our
ethics
or
integrity,
or
who
wishes
to
report
incidents
of
fraud
or
abuse,
may
lodge
an
anonymous
complaint\nthrough
an
externally-managed
web-based
platform
or
hotline
without
fear
of
retaliation.\nWe
actively
seek
to
comply
with
all
local,
state
and
federal
employment
laws
and
we
monitor
current
and
emerging
labor
and
human
capital
management
risks
and\nmitigate
exposure
to
those
risks.\nGOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS\nWe
operate
in
an
industry
that
is
subject
to
extensive
environmental
regulation,
which
has
become
more
stringent
over
time.
The
laws
and
regulations
to
which
we
are\nsubject
govern,
among
others,
vehicle
emissions
and
the
storage,
handling,
treatment,
transportation
and
disposal
of
hazardous
materials
and
the
remediation
of
environmental\ncontamination.
Compliance
with
such
laws
and
regulations
at
an
international,
regional,
national,
provincial
and
local
level
is
an
important
aspect
of
our
ability
to
continue
our\noperations.\nEnvironmental
standards
applicable
to
us
are
established
by
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
countries
in
which
we
operate,
standards
adopted
by
regulatory
agencies
and\nthe
permits
and
licenses
issued
to
us.
Each
of
these
sources
is
subject
to
periodic
modifications
and
what
we
anticipate
will
be
increasingly
stringent
requirements.
Violations
of\nthese
laws,
regulations
or
permits
and
licenses
may
result
in
substantial
administrative,
civil
or
even
criminal
fines,
penalties
and
possibly
orders
to
cease
any
violating
operations
or\nto
conduct
or
pay
for
corrective
works.
In
some
instances,
violations
may
also
result
in
the
suspension
or
revocation
of
permits
or
licenses.\nEmissions\nCalifornia
has
greenhouse
gas
emissions
standards
that
closely
follow
the
standards
of
the
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(the
“EPA”),
as
well
as
requirements
for\nautomakers
to
sell
increasing
fractions
of
zero
emission
vehicles
(""ZEVs"").
The
registration
and
sale
of
ZEVs
in
California
could
earn
us
ZEV
credits
that
we
could
in
turn
sell
to\ntraditional
OEMs
looking
to
meet
their
ZEV
sales
and
greenhouse
gas
reduction
targets
in
order
to
meet
California’s
ZEV
targets
and
state
and
federal
emissions
regulations.
Other\nU.S.
states
have
adopted
similar
ZEV
standards
including
Colorado,
Connecticut,
Maine,
Maryland,
Massachusetts,
Minnesota,
Nevada,
New
Jersey,
New
Mexico,
New
York,\nOregon,
Rhode
Island,
Vermont,
Virginia,
and
Washington.
We
intend
to
take
advantage
of
these
regimes
by
registering
and
selling
ZEVs
in
these
other
U.S.
states.\nZEV
credits
in
California
or
other
states
are
calculated
under
the
California
Air

Board
(“CARB”)
ZEV
Regulation

Battery
Electric
Vehicles
(“BEVs”),
Fuel
Cell
Electric
Vehicles
(“FCEVs”),
and
Plug-In
Hybrid
Electric
Vehicles
(""PHEVs"").
The
ZEV\nprogram
assigns
ZEV
credits
to
each
vehicle
manufacturer.
Vehicle
manufacturers
are
required
to
maintain
ZEV
credits
equal
to
a
set
percentage
of

may
benefit
from
certain
provisions
of
the
Inflation
Reduction
Act
(“IRA”),
which
Congress
passed
and
the
President
signed
into
law
in
2022.\nMany
of
the
provisions
of
that
law
took
effect
after
December
31,
2022.\nSpecifically,
Canoo
customers
will
benefit
from
the
IRA’s
Commercial
Clean

Tax
Credit
(Internal
Revenue
Code
(“I.R.C.”)
Section
45W).
Customers
that
place\nCanoo

in
2023
are
eligible
for
the
maximum
amount
of
that

Tribal,
state,
and
local
governments
may
be
able
to
realize
comparable\nbenefits
utilizing
the
IRA’s
direct

As
such,
the
Company
may
benefit
from\nthe
IRA’s
Advanced
Manufacturing
Production
Tax
Credit
(I.R.C.
Section
45X).
Subject
to
certain
conditions,
manufacturers
can
claim
a
credit
for
each
battery
module
or
other\neligible
component
made
in
the
United
States.\nCanoo
may
benefit
indirectly
from
$7.5
billion
in
Bipartisan
Infrastructure
Law
funding
made
available
beginning
in
2022
to
build
out
a
nationwide
network
of
electric\nvehicle
fast
charging
stations.
The
Company
may
also
be
eligible
for
a
loan
pursuant
to
the
Advanced
Technology
Vehicles
Manufacturing
Loan
Program
administered
by
the
U.S.\nDepartment
of
Energy.\nIn
addition
to
federal
tax
credits,
some
U.S.
states
maintain
laws
that
encourage
the
purchase
of
eligible
zero
emission
vehicles.
For
example,
California,
Colorado,\nOregon,
and
Texas
provide
state
tax
credits
or
rebates
for
the
purchase
of
EVs.
New
Jersey
and
Washington
exempt
the
purchase
of
EVs
from
state
sales
tax.
Other
inducements\ninclude
preferential
parking
or
dedicated
highway
lanes.\nSome
of
these
programs
have
eligibility
limits
based
on
either
consumer
income
or
the
manufacturer’s
suggested
retail
price
of
the
vehicle.
Others
will
supply
rebates
or\ncredits
only
until
a
set
aside
amount
of
funding
or
credit
authority
exists.
Several
states
plan
to
phase
out
inducements
over
time
or
as
a
specific
volume
of
eligible
vehicles
is
sold.\nMany
U.S.
states
and
municipalities,
as
well
as
certain
private
organizations,
offer
financial
and
other
incentives
to
businesses
to
encourage
investment
and
economic\ndevelopment
in
particular
areas.
These
incentives
generally
are
conditional
and
depend
on
meeting
agreed
performance
requirements,
such
as
creating
a
specific
number
of
jobs
or\npaying
a
minimum
average
annual
wage.\nIn
2022,
Canoo
announced
plans
to
establish
a
vehicle
manufacturing
facility
in
Oklahoma
City,
Oklahoma
and
a
battery
module
manufacturing
facility
in
Pryor,\nOklahoma.
For
these
planned
investments,
state
and
local

will
be
subject
to,
and
will
be
required
to
comply
with,
the
National
Traffic
and
Motor
Vehicle
Safety
Act,
as
amended,
and
numerous
regulatory\nrequirements
established
by
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
(“NHTSA”),
an
operating
administration
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Transportation,
including\napplicable
U.S.
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards
(“FMVSS”).
We
intend
for
our
Lifestyle
Vehicles
to
fully
comply
with
all
applicable
FMVSS
without
the
need
for
any\nexemptions,
and
expect
our
future
EVs
to
either
fully
comply
or
comply
with
limited
exemptions
related
to
new
technologies.\nAs
a
manufacturer,
we
must
self-certify
that
our
vehicles
meet
all
applicable
FMVSS,
as
well
as
the
NHTSA
bumper
standard,
or
otherwise
are
exempt,
before
the\nvehicles
can
be
manufactured
for
sale,
sold,
offered
for
sale,
introduced
or
delivered
for
introduction
in
interstate
commerce,
or
imported
into
the
United
States.
Numerous
FMVSS\nwill
apply
to
our
vehicles,
such
as
crash-worthiness
requirements,
crash
avoidance
requirements
and
EV-specific
requirements.
We
will
also
be
required
to
comply
with
other\nfederal
laws
and
regulations
administered
by
NHTSA,
including,
among
other
things,
ensuring
our
vehicles
do
not
contain
defects
related
to
motor
vehicle
safety,
recall\nrequirements,
the
corporate
average
fuel
economy
(“CAFE”)
standards,
Theft
Prevention
Act
requirements,
consumer
information
labeling
requirements,
reporting
required
notices,\nbulletins
and
other
communications,
TREAD
Act/Early
Warning
Information
reporting,
foreign
recall
reporting
and
owner’s
manual
requirements.\nThe
Automobile
Information
and

Act
requires
manufacturers
of
motor
vehicles
to
disclose
certain
information
regarding
the
manufacturer’s
suggested
retail\nprice,
optional
equipment
and
pricing.
In
addition,
this
law
allows
inclusion
of
city
and
highway
fuel
economy
ratings,
as
determined
by
EPA,
as
well
as
crash
test
ratings
as\ndetermined
by
NHTSA
if
such
tests
are
conducted.\nIf
we
expand
our
offerings
outside
of
the
United
States,
our
vehicles
will
be
subject
to
foreign
safety,
environmental
and
other
regulations.
Many
of
those
regulations
are\ndifferent
from
those
applicable
in
the
United
States
and
may
require
redesign
and/or
retesting.
For
example,
the
European
Union
(“E.U.”)
has
established
new
approval
and\noversight
rules
requiring
that
a
national
authority
certify
compliance
with
heightened
safety
rules,
emissions
limits
and
production
requirements
before
vehicles
can
be
sold
in
each\nE.U.
member
state,
the
initial
of
which
rules
were
rolled
out
on
September
1,
2020.
Both
domestically
and
abroad
regulations
that
apply
to
our
vehicles
may
change
over
time,
so\nwe
will
regularly
evaluate
these
change
and
proposed
changes
to
ensure
our
vehicles
can
remain
available
to
the
markets
we
serve.\nIn
addition
to
the
various
territorial
legal
requirements
we
are
obligated
to
meet,
our
Lifestyle
Vehicles
are
engineered
to
deliver
overall
5-star
performance
in
the
two\nmain
voluntary
vehicle
safety
performance
assessment
programs,
U.S.
NCAP
and
Euro
NCAP.
Five-star
is
the
maximum
attainable
score.
These
independent
organizations
have\nintroduced
a
number
of
additional
safety
related
tests
aimed
at
improving
the
safety
of
passenger
vehicles,
both
for
occupants
and
pedestrians
involved
in
collisions
with
vehicles.\nAutomobile
Manufacturer
and
Dealer
Regulation\nIn
the
United
States,
state
laws
regulate
the
manufacture,
distribution,
sale
and
service
of
automobiles,
and
generally
require
motor
vehicle
manufacturers
and
dealers
to
be\nlicensed
in
order
to
sell
vehicles
directly
to
residents.
Canoo
currently
is
licensed
to
sell
vehicles
by
the
State
of
California.
With
that
license,
we
can
sell
to
customers
across
the\ncountry
as
a
matter
of
interstate
commerce.\nHowever,
certain
other
states
do
not
permit
automobile
manufacturers
to
be
licensed
as
dealers
or
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
a
dealer,
or
otherwise
restrict
a
manufacturer’s\nability
to
deliver
or
service
vehicles.
Some
automobile
dealer
trade
associations
have
challenged
the
legality
of
direct
selling
by
motor
vehicle
manufacturers
in
court
or
have
used\nadministrative
and
legislative
processes
to
attempt
to
prohibit
or
limit
manufacturers’
ability
to
operate
existing
dealerships
or
to
expand
to
new
locations.
Certain
dealer
associations\nhave
lobbied
state
licensing
agencies
and
legislators
to
interpret
existing
laws
or
to
enact
new
laws
in
ways
that
prevent
manufacturers
from
selling
vehicles
to
customers.\n17\n',

Safety
and
Testing
Regulation\nOur
battery
pack
conforms
to
mandatory
regulations
that
govern
transport
of
“dangerous
goods,”
defined
to
include
lithium-ion
batteries,
which
may
present
a
risk
in\ntransportation.
The
governing
regulations,
which
are
issued
by
the
Pipeline
and
Hazardous
Materials
Safety
Administration,
are
based
on
the
UN
Recommendations
on
the
Safe\nTransport
of
Dangerous
Goods
Model
Regulations
and
related
UN
Manual
Tests
and
Criteria.
The
regulations
vary
by
mode
of
shipping
transportation,
such
as
by
ocean
vessel,\nrail,
truck
or
air.
Prior
to
launch,
we
plan
to
complete
all
applicable
transportation
tests
for
our
battery
packs,
demonstrating
our
compliance
with
applicable
regulations.
We
will
use\nlithium-ion
cells
in
the
high
voltage
battery
packs
in
our
vehicles.
The
use,
storage,
and
disposal
of
our
battery
packs
is
regulated
under
federal
law.\nOur
battery
packs
are
intended
to
meet
the
applicable
compliance
requirements
of
the
UN
Manual
of
Tests
and
Criteria
demonstrating
our
ability
to
ship
battery
packs
by\nany
method.\nThese
tests
include:\nAltitude

—
simulating
air
transport;\nThermal
cycling
—
assessing

and\nOvercharge
—
evaluating
the
ability
of

to
withstand
overcharging.\nCOMPETITION\nWe
have
experienced,
and
expect
to
continue
to
experience,
intense
competition
from
a
number
of
companies,
particularly
as
the
transportation
sector
increasingly
shifts\ntowards
low-emission,
zero-emission
or
carbon
neutral
solutions.
Competing
vehicles
include
internal
combustion
vehicles
from
established
automobile
manufacturers
as
well
as\nalternative
fuel
and
electric
vehicles
manufactured,
or
to
be
manufactured,
by
established
and
new
automobile
manufacturers.
Many
major
automobile
manufacturers
currently\noffer
EVs
and
hybrid
vehicles,
including
plug-in
versions,
and
many
prospective
automobile
manufacturers
are
developing
EVs.
In
recent
years,
interest
in
EVs
from
public\ninvestors
has
made
access
to
public
capital
more
readily
available
for
newer
entrants
into
the
EV
market,
which
in
turn
has
increased
the
number
of
viable
competitors.
We
believe\nthe
primary
competitive
factors
in
the
EV
market
include,
but
are
not
limited
to:\n•\nproduct
availability;\n•\ntechnological
innovation;\n•\nproduct

Related
to

Financial
Results\nWe
are
an
early
stage
company
with
a
history
of
losses
and
expect
to
incur
significant
expenses
and
continuing
losses
for
the
foreseeable

incurred
a
net
loss
and
comprehensive
loss
of
$487.7
million
and
$346.8
million,
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
2022
and
2021,
respectively.
We
believe
we
will\ncontinue
to
incur
operating
and
net
losses
and
comprehensive
losses
each
quarter,
at
least
until
we
significantly
advance
operations
and
produce
and
deliver
our

in

Furthermore,
although
we
believe
the

modularity
of\nour

platform
will
allow
us
to
reduce
costs
to
develop

manufacture

we

this
will
be
the
case
and
the
development
and
manufacture
of
new\nvehicle
models
may
require
greater
capital
expenditure
than
anticipated.
In
addition,
we
may
incur
significant
costs
associated
with
developing
and
operating
both
effective
sales\nchannels
as
well
as
a
robust
service
and
maintenance
network
for
our

Our
ability
to
become
profitable
in
the
future
will
not
only
depend
on
our
ability
to
complete
the
design\nand
development
of
our
EVs
to
meet
projected
performance
metrics,
identify
and
investigate
new
areas
of
demand
and

also

and
costs,
including
the
risks
and
costs
associated
with

our

If

are
unable
to
efficiently
design,
develop,
manufacture,
market,
deploy,
distribute
and
service
our
EVs,
our
margins,
profitability\nand
prospects
would
be
materially

current
business
plans
require
a
significant
amount
of
capital.
If

are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
funding
or
do
not
have
access
to
capital,
we
may
not
be
able
to
execute\nour
business
plans
and
our
prospects,
financial
condition
and
results
of
operations
could
be
materially
adversely

have
experienced
operating
losses,
and
we
expect
to
continue
to
incur
operating
losses
as
we
implement
our
business
plans.
We
expect
our
capital
expenditures
to\ncontinue
to
be
significant
in
the
foreseeable
future
as
we
expand
our
business.
We
expect
to
expend
capital
with
significant
outlays
directed
both
toward
bringing
our
current
vehicle\nprograms
to
market
as
well
as
developing
additional
vehicles,
along
with
related
products
and
service
offerings.
The
fact
that
we
have
a
limited
operating
history
means
we
have\nlimited
historical
data
on
the
demand
for
our
EVs
and
other
products.
As
a
result,
our
future
capital
requirements
may
be
uncertain
and
actual
capital
requirements
may
be
different\nfrom
those
we
currently
anticipate.
In
addition,
new
opportunities
for
growth
in
future
product
lines
and
markets
may
arise
and
may
require
additional
capital.\nDuring
the
fourth
quarter
of
2022,
our
principal
sources
of
liquidity
were
proceeds
from
the
ATM
Offering
(Note
14)

well
as
our\nunrestricted

raise
additional
capital
in
order
to
continue
to
execute
our
business
plans
in
the
future,
and
we
plan
to
seek
equity
and/or
debt
financing,
including
by
offering
additional
equity,\nand/or
equity-linked
securities,
through
one
or
more
credit
facilities
and
potentially
by
offering
debt
securities,
to
finance
a
portion
of
our
future
expenditures.
The
global\nmacroeconomic
environment
and
the
resulting
negative
impacts
on
capital
markets
as
well
as
other
geopolitical
forces
may
make
it
more
difficult
for
us
to
raise
additional
funds.\nThe
sale
of
additional
equity
or
equity-linked
securities
could
dilute
our
stockholders.
The
incurrence
of
indebtedness
would
result
in
increased
debt
service
obligations
and\ncould
result
in
operating
and
financing
covenants
that
would
restrict
our
operations
or
our
ability
to
pay
dividends
to
our
stockholders.
Our
ability
to
obtain
the
necessary
additional\nfinancing
to
carry
out
our
business
plans
or
to
refinance,
if
necessary,
any
outstanding
debt
when
due
is
subject
to
a
number
of
factors,
including
general
market
conditions,
which\ncontinue
to
experience
volatility
and
disruptions
as
a
result
of
inflation
and
interest
rate
changes,
and
investor
acceptance
of
our
business
model.
These
factors
may
make
the
timing,\namount,
terms
and
conditions
of
such
financing
unattractive
or
unavailable
to
us.
If
we
are
unable
to
raise
sufficient
funds
on
favorable
terms,
we
may
have
to
significantly
reduce\nour
spending,
delay
or
cancel
our
planned
activities
or
substantially
change
our
corporate
structure.
We
might
not
be
able
to
obtain
any
such
funding
or
we
might
not
have
sufficient\nresources
to
conduct
our
business
as
projected,
both
of
which
could
mean
that
we
would
be
forced
to
curtail
or
discontinue
our
operations
and
our
prospects,
financial
consolidated\nresults
of
operations
could
be
materially
adversely
affected,
in
which
case
our
investors
could
lose
some
or
all
of
their
investment.\nOur
management
has
performed
an
analysis
of
our
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
and
has
identified
substantial
doubt
about
our
ability
to
continue
as
a
going\nconcern.
If
we
are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
additional
funding
or
do
not
have
access
to
capital,
we
may
be
required
to
terminate
or
significantly
curtail
our
operations.\nBased
on
their
assessment,
our
management
has
raised
concerns
about
our
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern.
Management
continues
to
explore
raising
additional\ncapital
through
a
combination
of
debt
financing,
other
non-dilutive
financing
and/or
equity
financing
to
supplement
the
Company’s
capitalization
and
liquidity.
However,
as\nsubstantial
doubt
about
our
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
exists,
our
ability
to
finance
our
operations
through
the
sale
and
issuance
of
additional
debt
or
equity
securities
or\nthrough
bank
or
other
financing
could
be
impaired
and
management
cannot
conclude
as
of
the
date
of
this
filing
that
its
plans
are
probable
of
being
successfully
implemented.
As
of\nthe
date
of
this
report,
we
believe
that
our
existing
cash
resources
and
additional
sources
of
liquidity
are
not
sufficient
to
support
planned
operations
for
the
next
12
months.
Our\nability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
will
depend
on
our
ability
to
obtain
additional
capital.\nDuring
the
fourth
quarter
of
2022,
our
principal
sources
of
liquidity
were
proceeds
from
the
ATM
Offering
(Note
14)
and
Yorkville
PPA
(Notes
9
and
14),
as
well
as
our\nunrestricted
cash
balance
in
the
amount
of
$36.6
million
as
of
December
31,
2022.
The
decision
regarding
future
sales
of
shares
through
the
ATM
Offering
is
subject
to
market\nconditions,
such
as
trading
volume,
price
of
our
Common
Stock
and
other
factors
beyond
our
control,
as
well
as
conditions
included
in
the
programs’
governing
documents.
As
of\nMarch
27,
2023,
we
had
issued
an
aggregate
of
36.3
million
shares
under
the
ATM
Offering.
There
is
no
guarantee
that
we
will
be
able
to
sell
any
additional
shares
and
receive
any\nadditional
proceeds
from
the
ATM
Offering.
Therefore,
our
current
sources
of
financing
remain
limited.\nWe
continue
to
explore
potential
sources
of
capital
financing.
However,
additional
capital
may
not
be
available
on
favorable
terms,
or
at
all,
and
additional
equity\nfinancing,
including
shares
issued
under
the
ATM
Offering,
will
further
dilute
our
current
stockholders.
If
we
raise
additional
funds
by
issuing
debt
securities
or
preferred
stock,
or\nby
incurring
additional
loans,
these
forms
of
financing
would
have
rights,
preferences,
and
privileges
senior
to
those
of
holders
of
our
Common
Stock.
If
adequate
capital
is
not\navailable
to
us
in
the
amounts
needed,
we
could
be
required
to
terminate
or
significantly
curtail
our
operations
in
which
case
our
investors
could
lose
some
or
all
of
their
investment.\nAdverse
developments
affecting
the
financial
services
industry,
such
as
actual
events
or
concerns
involving
liquidity,
defaults
or
non-performance
by
financial
institutions\ncould
adversely
affect
our
current
financial
condition
and
projected
business
operations.\nActual
events
involving
limited
liquidity,
defaults,
non-performance
or
other
adverse
developments
that
affect
financial
institutions,
transactional
counterparties
or
other\ncompanies
in
the
financial
services
industry
or
the
financial
services
industry
generally,
or
concerns
or
rumors
about
any
events
of
these
kinds
or
other
similar
risks,
have
in
the
past\nand
may
in
the
future
lead
to
market-wide
liquidity
problems.
In
addition,
there
is
the
possibility
that
we
may
not
be
able
to
access
a
portion
of
our
existing
cash
and
cash\nequivalents
and
investments
in
marketable
securities
due
to
market
conditions.
For
example,
on
March
10,
2023,
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corporation,
or
the
FDIC,
took\ncontrol
and
was
appointed
receiver
of
Silicon
Valley
Bank,
one
of
our
banking
partners.
If
other
banks
and
financial
institutions
enter
receivership
or
become
insolvent
in
the
future\nin
response
to
financial
conditions
affecting
the
banking
system
and
financial
markets,
our
ability
to
access
our
cash
and
cash
equivalents
and
investments
in
marketable
securities\nmay
be
threatened
and
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business
and
financial
condition.\n23\n',

of
Contents\nWe
have
not
achieved
positive
operating
cash
flow
and,
given
our
projected
funding
needs,
our
ability
to
generate
positive
cash
flow
is
uncertain.\nWe
have
had
negative
cash
flow
from
operating
activities
of
$400.5
million
and
$300.8
million
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
2022
and
2021,
respectively.
We
expect\nto
continue
to
have
negative
cash
flow
from
operating
and
investing
activities
for
2023
as
we
will
continue
to
incur
research
and
development,
sales
and
marketing,
and
general
and\nadministrative
expenses
and
make
capital
expenditures
in
our
efforts
to
develop
and
tool
our
facilities
for
production,
increase
sales,
engage
in
development
work
and
ramp
up\noperations,
including
capital
expenditures
directed
towards
the
manufacturing
of
our
EVs.
Our
business
also
will
at
times
require
significant
amounts
of
working
capital
to
support\nthe
growth
of
additional
EV
platforms
and
vehicle
models.
An
inability
to
generate
positive
cash
flow
may
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
raise
needed
capital
for
our
business
on\nreasonable
terms,
diminish
supplier
or
customer
willingness
to
enter
into
transactions
with
us,
and
have
other
adverse
effects
that
may
decrease
our
long-term
viability.
There
can\nbe
no
assurance
that
we
will
achieve
positive
cash
flow
in
the
near
future
or
at
all.\nOur
financial
results
may
vary
significantly
from
period
to
period
due
to
fluctuations
in
our
operating
costs,
product
demand
and
other
factors.\nWe
expect
our
period-to-period
financial
results
to
vary
based
on
our
operating
costs
and
product
demand,
which
we
anticipate
will
fluctuate
as
the
pace
at
which
we\ncontinue
to
design,
develop
and
manufacture
new
EVs,
increase
production
capacity
and
establish
or
expand
design,
research
and
development,
production,
sales
and
service\nfacilities.
Fluctuations
in
our
period-to-period
financial
results
may
be
further
exacerbated
as
a
result
of
factors
beyond
our
control,
including
inflation,
changes
in
interest
rates,\ndemand
for
components
and
materials,
and
cost
of
labor.
Additionally,
our
revenue
from
period
to
period
may
fluctuate
as
we
identify
and
investigate
areas
of
demand,
adjust\nvolumes
and
add
new
product
derivatives
based
on
market
demand
and
margin
opportunities,
develop
and
introduce
new
EVs
or
introduce
existing
EVs
to
new
markets
for
the
first\ntime.
As
a
result
of
these
factors,
we
believe
that
quarter-to-quarter
comparisons
of
our
financial
results
are
not
and
will
not
be
necessarily
meaningful
for
the
foreseeable
future
and\nthat
these
comparisons
cannot
be
relied
upon
as
indicators
of
future
performance.
Moreover,
our
financial
results
may
not
meet
expectations
of
equity
research
analysts,
ratings\nagencies
or
investors,
who
may
be
focused
only
on
quarterly
financial
results.
If
any
of
this
occurs,
the
trading
price
of
our
Common
Stock
could
fall
substantially,
either
suddenly\nor
over
time.\nOur
limited
operating
history
makes
evaluating
our
business
and
future
prospects
difficult
and
increases
the
risk
of
your
investment.\nYou
must
consider
the
risks
and
difficulties
we
face
as
an
early
stage
company
with
a
limited
operating
history.
If
we
do
not
successfully
address
these
risks,
our
business,\nprospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
will
be
materially
and
adversely
harmed.
Legacy
Canoo
was
incorporated
in
November
2017,
and
we
became
a
public
company\nin
late
2020.
As
a
result,
we
have
a
very
limited
operating
history
on
which
investors
can
base
an
evaluation
of
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nThere
are
no
assurances
that
we
will
be
able
to
secure
future
business
with
customers.\nIt
is
difficult
to
predict
our
future
revenue
and
appropriately
budget
for
our
expenses,
and
we
have
limited
insight
into
trends
that
may
emerge
and
affect
our
business.
In\nthe
event
that
actual
results
differ
from
our
estimates
or
we
adjust
our
estimates
in
future
periods,
our
operating
results
and
financial
position
could
be
materially
affected.\nWe
previously
identified
material
weaknesses
in
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting.
Although
the
weaknesses
previously
identified
have
been
remediated,
if
we\nidentify
additional
material
weaknesses
in
the
future
or
otherwise
fail
to
maintain
an
effective
system
of
internal
controls,
we
may
not
be
able
to
accurately
or
timely
report
our\nfinancial
condition
or
results
of
operations,
which
may
adversely
affect
our
business
and
stock
price.\nIn
connection
with
the
preparation
and
audit
of
our
consolidated
financial
statements
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2019,
we
identified
material
weaknesses
in
our\ninternal
control
over
financial
reporting.
A
material
weakness
is
a
deficiency,
or
combination
of
deficiencies,
in
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
such
that
there
is
a\nreasonable
possibility
that
a
material
misstatement
of
our
annual
or
interim
consolidated
financial
statements
will
not
be
prevented
or
detected
on
a
timely
basis.\nAlthough
the
identified
weaknesses
have
been
remediated,
we
cannot
assure
you
that
we
will
not
identify
other
material
weaknesses
in
the
future
and
that
the
measures
we\nmay
take
in
that
case,
will
be
sufficient
to
remediate
any
control
deficiencies.
The
effectiveness
of
our
internal

We

We

to
include:\n•\ndeveloping

if

our

harmed.\nOur
success
depends,
in

on
our

to
retain
our
key
personnel.
The
unexpected
loss
of
or
failure
to
retain
one
or
more
of
our
key

could
adversely
affect\nour

In
particular,
we
are
highly
dependent
on
the

and
reputation
of
Tony
Aquila,
our
Chief
Executive
Officer
and
Executive
Chair.
Mr.
Aquila
is
a
significant\ninfluence

If

reason,
or
if
his
reputation
is

by\npersonal
actions
or
omissions
or
other
events
within
or
outside
his

we
would
be

also
depends,
in
part,
on
our
continuing
ability
to
identify,

attract,

and
develop
other
highly
qualified
personnel.
We
intend
to
continue
to
hire
a\nsignificant
number
of
additional
personnel,
including
software
engineers,
design
and
production
personnel
and
service
technicians
for
our
EVs
and
related
products,
including
our\nsoftware
offerings.
Competition
for
individuals
with
experience
designing,
producing
and
servicing
EVs
and
automotive
software
is
intense
particularly
given
current
labor\nshortages.
As
a
result,
it
may
be
challenging
to
attract,
hire
and
retain
skilled

in
particular
automotive

and

engineers.
The
geographic
location
of
the\nareas
where
we
operate
or
intend
to
operate,
including
Arkansas,
Oklahoma,
Michigan,
Texas
and
Southern
California
may
exacerbate
these
challenges
given
that
availability
of\nskilled
personnel
with
experience
in

and

software
may
not
be
as
readily
or
historically
available
in
certain
of

in
the
near
term,
the
successful
launch
and
ramp
up
of
our
manufacturing
operations
will
require
the
hiring
of
substantial
numbers
of
new
personnel.
Because\nour
EVs
are
based
on
a
different
technology
platform
than
traditional
internal
combustion
engines,
individuals
with
sufficient
training
in
alternative
fuel
and
EVs
may
not
be\navailable
to
hire,
and
as
a
result,
we
expect
to
expend
significant
time
and
expense
training
any
newly
hired
employees.
The
timely
and
successful
launch
of
our
manufacturing\noperations,
and
thus
our
vehicle
programs,
is
dependent
upon
on
our
ability
to
identify,
hire,
attract,
train
and
retain
enough
qualified
personnel
to
develop
our
facilities
and
initiate\nproduction
of
our
EVs
at
scale.\n25\n',

Document(page_content='Table
of
Contents\nWe
face
significant
barriers
to
manufacture
and
bring
our
EVs
to
market,
and
if
we
cannot
successfully
overcome
those
barriers
our
business
will
be
negatively
impacted.\nThe
EV
industry
has
traditionally
been
characterized
by
significant
barriers
to
entry,
including
the
ability
to
meet
performance
requirements
or
industry
specifications,\nacceptance
by
end
users,
large
capital
requirements,
investment
costs
of
design
and
production,
long
lead
times
to
bring
EVs
to
market
from
the
concept
and
design
stage,
the
need\nfor
specialized
design
and
development
expertise,
regulatory
requirements,
establishing
a
brand
name
and
image
the
need
to
establish
sales
capabilities,
and
increasing
competition\nof
more
established
companies.
If
we
are
not
able
to
overcome
these
barriers,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
will
be
negatively
impacted
and
our\nability
to
grow
our
business
will
be
harmed.\nOutstanding
amounts
under
the
PPA
will
make
us
more
vulnerable
to
downturns
in
our
financial
condition.\nAs
of
March
24,
2023,
there
are
no
Pre-Paid
Advances
outstanding
under
the
PPA.
Under
the
terms
of
the
PPA,
there
are
certain
conditions
precedent
to
each
Pre-Paid\nAdvance,
including,
among
others,
that
the
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock
is
greater
than
$1.50
per
share
as
measured
by
the
average
daily
VWAP
for
each
of
the
three\nconsecutive
trading
days
immediately
prior
to
the
date
of
determination.
As
such,
additional
capital
under
the
PPA
will
not
be
available
to
the
Company
without
Yorkville
waiving\nthe
share
price
condition
discussed
in
the
preceding
sentence
unless
the
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock
increases
above
$1.50.
If
there
are
subsequent
Pre-Paid
Advances
under\nthe
PPA,
our
cash
flow
from
operations
may
be
insufficient
to
meet
our
payment
obligations
under
the
PPA,
in
which
case
we
could
incur
an
event
of
the
default
under
the
PPA\nwhich
would
cause
all
outstanding
amounts
to
become
immediately
due
and
payable.
Furthermore,
under
the
terms
of
the
PPA,
if
there
are
any
amounts
outstanding
under
a
Pre-\nPaid
Advance,
we
would
be
unable
to
continue
issuing
shares
of
Common
Stock
under
the
ATM
Offering
without
prior
consent
from
Yorkville.
Any
subsequent
debt
we
may
owe\nYorkville
under
the
PPA
or
any
other
debt
owed
to
other
parties
could
make
us
more
vulnerable
to
a
downturn
in
our
operating
results
or
a
downturn
in
economic
conditions.
If
our\ncash
flow
from
operations
is
insufficient
to
meet
any
debt
service
requirements
or
we
incur
an
event
of
default,
we
could
be
required
to
refinance
our
obligations,
or
dispose
of\nassets
in
order
to
meet
debt
service
requirements.\nCustomers
who
have
committed
to
purchase
significant
amounts
of
our
vehicles
may
purchase
significantly
fewer
vehicles
than
we
currently
anticipate
or
none
at
all.
In
that\ncase,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations,
and
cash
flows
could
be
materially
and
adversely
affected.\nOur
future
success
depends
on
us
commencing
commercial
sales
and
attracting
a
large
number
of
customers
for
our
EVs.
In
the
near-term,
if
we
are
able
to
complete
the\ndevelopment
of
our
MPP
and
EVs,
we
have
secured
commitments
from
Walmart,
Zeeba
and
Kingbee
to
purchase
vehicles.
Pursuant
to
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreements,
such
parties\nagreed
to
purchase
certain
specific
number
of
EVs,
in
each
case
with
an
option
to
purchase
additional
EVs.
Such
parties’
purchases
are
subject
to
us
meeting
certain
acceptance
and\nperformance
criteria
with
respect
to
EVs.
If
we
are
unable
to
meet
such
requirements,
such
parties
may
terminate
the
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreements
or
decide
to
purchase
fewer\nvehicles
than
expected.
Walmart
also
has
the
right
to
terminate
the
Walmart
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreement
for
convenience
upon
at
least
30
days’
written
notice.
Furthermore,
these\nparties
may
not
have
the
financial
resources
to
purchase
vehicles
from
us.
If
these
parties
terminate
the
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreements
or
purchase
less
EVs
than
expected
or
none\nat
all,
we
will
not
realize
the
revenue
that
we
expect
to
realize
from
these
agreements.\nIn
addition,
the
automotive
market
is
highly
competitive,
and
our
relationship
with
Walmart
will
limit
our
access
to
certain
customers
that
could
represent
substantial\nbusiness
opportunities.
Under
the
Walmart
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreement,
we
granted
Walmart
exclusivity
rights,
which
restrict
our
ability
to
contract
with
Amazon.com,
Inc.,
its\nsubsidiaries,
or
affiliates.
If
due
to
the
exclusivity
granted
to
Walmart,
we
cannot
sell
our
EVs
to
these
customers,
our
operations
may
be
adversely
impacted.
Furthermore,
our\ncommercial
relationship
with
Walmart,
together
with
its
ownership
of
our
Common
Stock
as
a
result
of
the
exercise
of
the
Warrant
we
issued
to
Walmart,
may
deter
Walmart’s\ncompetitors
or
other
third
parties
from
contracting
with
us.\nAs
a
result
of
the
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreements,
we
will
make
substantial
capital
investments
and
strategic
business
decisions.
If
we
are
unable
to
maintain
our\nrelationships
with
Walmart,
Zeeba
or
Kingbee
or
other
similar
parties,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations,
and
cash
flows
could
be
materially
and\nadversely
affected.\n26\n',

In

with

However,
we
have
significant

to
achieve
before

and\nwe
have
had
to
delay

reassess
our

various
times
in

manufacturing
of

Given
that
for

will
depend
on
a
limited

of

to\nthe
extent
a
particular
model
is
not
well-received
by
the
market,
our
sales
volume
could
be
materially
and
adversely
affected.
This
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our\nbusiness,

financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nThere
is
no
guarantee
that
we
will
be

Ecosystem,
or
that
if
we
are
able
to
develop
it,
that
we
will
obtain
the
revenue
and\nother
benefits
we
expect.\nIn
addition
to
our
vehicle
technology,
we
are
developing
a
software
platform
intended
to
aggregate
car
data
from
both
our
EVs
and
other
vehicles
to
deliver
certain\ninformation
to
our
customers.
We
believe
this
software
will
be
an
important
component
to
maximize
utility
and
value
from
the
vehicle
ownership
experience.
Leveraging
our
data\naggregation
platform,
we
are
planning
to
create
an
“application
store,”
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
to
centralize
vehicle
information
for
customers.
We
expect
some\nfunctionalities
will
be
packaged
with
the
vehicle,
while
others
are
expected
to
be
offered
as
upgradeable
options.
In
addition,
we
plan
to
assess
partnerships
with
third
parties
for\ncertain
services
accessed
through
our
software,
such
as
financing
or
insurance.
If
we
are
unable
to
develop
our
software
platform
or
market
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
or
if\ncustomers
do
not
consider
it
valuable
or
do
not
use
it
as
intended,
we
may
not
achieve
the
benefits
we
expect
and
our

may
be

than
expected,
all
of
which
could\nadversely
affect
our
business,

financial
condition,
results
of
operations,
and
cash

may
fail
to
attract
new
customers
in
sufficient
numbers
or
at
sufficient
rates
or
at
all
or
to
retain
existing
customers,
if
any,
and
may
face
risks
if
we
are
dependent
on
a\nsmall
number
of
customers
for
a
significant
portion
of
our
revenues.\nWe
must
continually
add
new
customers
both
to
replace
departing
customers
and
to
expand
our
current
customer
base.
We
may
not
be
able
to
attract
new
customers
in\nsufficient
numbers
to
do
so.
Even
if
we
are
able
to
attract
new
customers
to
replace
departing
customers,
these
new
customers
may
not
maintain
the
same
level
of
commitment.
In\naddition,
we
may
incur
marketing
or
other
expenses,
including
referral
fees,
to
attract
new
customers,
which
may
further
offset
revenue
from
customers.
For
these
and
other
reasons,\nwe
could
experience
a
decline
in
revenue
growth,
which
could
adversely
affect
our
results
of
operations.\nIf
consumers
do
not
perceive
our
product
offerings
to
be
of
value
or
our
EV
offerings
are
not
favorably
received
by
them,
we
may
not
be
able
to
attract
and
retain\ncustomers.
If
our
efforts
to
satisfy
and
retain
our
existing
customers
are
not
successful,
we
may
not
be
able
to
attract
new
customers,
and
as
a
result,
our
ability
to
maintain
and/or\ngrow
our
business
will
be
adversely
affected.
Customer
retention
will
also
be
largely
dependent
on
the
quality
and
effectiveness
of
our
customer
service
and
operations,
which
may\nbe
handled
internally
by
our
personnel
and
also
by
third-party
service
providers.
Outsourcing
of
certain
customer
service
and
claims
administration
functions
may
reduce
our
ability\nto
ensure
consistency
in
our
overall
customer
service
processes.
In
addition,
competitors
may
provide
a
better
value
or
services.
If
we
are
unable
to
successfully
compete
with\ncurrent
and
new
competitors
in
both
retaining
existing
customers
and
attracting
new
customers,
our
business
will
be
adversely
affected.\nIn
addition,
because
we
intend
to
focus
a
portion
of
our
selling
efforts
on
commercial
fleets,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle
and
MPDV,
we
may\nat
times
depend
upon
purchases
from
a
small
number
of
customers,
or
a
single
customer,
particularly
as
we
begin
to
develop
our
brand
reputation
and

base.
We
may
make\ncapital
investments
and
strategic
business
decisions
as
a
result
of
a
substantial
relationship
with
one
or
more
of
such

If

sales
volumes
with

customers
decrease
or
do
not
meet

whether
or
not
for
reasons
outside
of
our
control,
our
revenue
and\noperations
could
be
adversely
affected.\nFurthermore,
our

by
declines
in

or
failures
to
effectively
respond

Document(page_content='Table
of
Contents\nOur
business
and
prospects
depend
significantly
on
our
ability
to
build
the
Canoo
product
and
servicing
brand.
We
may
not
succeed
in
continuing
to
establish,
maintain
and\nstrengthen
the
Canoo
brand,
and
our
brand
and
reputation
could
be
harmed
by
negative
publicity
regarding
Canoo
or
our
EVs.\nOur
business
and
prospects
are
heavily
dependent
on
our
ability
to
develop,
maintain
and
strengthen
the
Canoo
brand.
If
we
are
unable
to
maintain
and
strengthen
our\nbrand,
we
may
lose
the
opportunity
to
sell
to
targeted
customers.
Promoting
and
positioning
our
brand
depends
significantly
on
our
ability
to
provide
high
quality
EVs
and
engage\nwith
our
customers
as
intended,
and
we
have
limited
experience
in
these
areas.
In
addition,
our
ability
to
develop,
maintain
and
strengthen
the
Canoo
brand
will
depend
heavily
on\nthe
success
of
our
customer
sales
and
development.
Such
efforts
mainly
include
building
a
community
of
online
and
offline
users
engaged
with
our
mobile
application
and
branding\ninitiatives,
such
as
targeted
marketing
programs
through
direct
marketing
to
potential
partners
and
localities.
Such
efforts
may
be
non-traditional
and
may
not
achieve
the
desired\nresults.
To
reach
targeted
sales
goals,
we
may
be
required
to
change
our
customer
development
and
branding
practices,
which
could
result
in
substantially
increased
expenses,\nincluding,
for
example,
the
increased
need
to
use
traditional
media
such
as
television,
radio
and
print
and
engage
celebrity
talent
or
brand
ambassadors.
Many
consumers
value\nsafety
and
reliability
as
important
factors
in
choosing
a
vehicle
and
may
be
reluctant
to
acquire
a
vehicle
from
a
new
and
unproven
automotive
maker.
In
addition,
our
novel\ntechnology
and
design
may
not
align
with
existing
consumer
preferences.
If
we
do
not
develop
and
maintain
a
strong
brand
and
product
alignment
with
potential
customers,
our\nbusiness,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
will
be
materially
and
adversely
impacted.\nIn
addition,
if
incidents
occur
or
are
perceived
to
have
occurred,
whether
or
not
such
incidents
are
within
our
control,
we
could
be
subject
to
adverse
publicity.
Given
the\npopularity
of
social
media,
any
negative
publicity,
whether
true
or
not,
could
quickly
proliferate
and
harm
consumer
perceptions
and
confidence
in
the
Canoo
brand.
Furthermore,\nthere
is
the
risk
of
potential
adverse
publicity
related
to
our
manufacturing
or
other
partners
whether
or
not
such
publicity
related
to
their
collaboration
with
us.
Our
ability
to\nsuccessfully
position
our
brand
could
also
be
adversely
affected
by
perceptions
about
the
quality
of
our
competitors’
vehicles.\nIn
addition,
from
time
to
time,
our
EVs
may
be
evaluated
and
reviewed
by
third
parties.
Any
negative
reviews
or
reviews
which
compare
us
unfavorably
to
competitors\ncould
adversely
affect
consumer
perception
about
our
EVs.\nIf
our
EVs
fail
to
perform
as
expected,
our
ability
to
develop,
market
and
deploy
our
EVs
could
be
harmed.\nOur
EVs
may
contain
defects
in
design
and
production
that
may
cause
them
not
to
perform
as
expected
or
may
require
repair.
We
currently
have
a
limited
frame
of\nreference
by
which
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
our
EVs.
There
can
be
no
assurance
that
we
will
be
able
to
detect
and
fix
any
defects
in
our
EVs.
We
may
experience
recalls
in\nthe
future,
which
could
adversely
affect
our
brand
and
could
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
Our
EVs
may
not
perform
consistent\nwith
customers’
expectations
or
consistent
with
other
vehicles
which
may
become
available.
Any
product
defects
or
any
other
failure
of
our
EVs
and
software
to
perform
as\nexpected
could
harm
our
reputation
and
result
in
adverse
publicity,
lost
revenue,
delivery
delays,
product
recalls,
negative
publicity,
product
liability
claims
and
significant\nwarranty
and
other
expenses
and
could
have
a
material
adverse
impact
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
Additionally,
problems
and
defects\nexperienced
by
other
electric
consumer
vehicles
could
by
association
have
a
negative
impact
on
perception
and
customer
demand
for
our
EVs.\nOur
distribution
model
may
expose
us
to
risk
and
if
unsuccessful,
may
impact
our
business
prospects
and
results
of
operations.\nWe
expect
to
offer
certain
of
our
vehicles
through
direct
sales
through
our
website
for
fleets,
individuals,
and
volume
orders.
Direct
sales
to
customers
rather
than
through\nfranchised
dealerships,
is
a
model
of
vehicle
distribution
that
is
relatively
new
and
is
different
from
the
predominant
current
distribution
model
for
automobile
manufacturers
and,\nwith
limited
exceptions,
unproven.
In
addition,
we
are
also
exploring
vehicle
sales
through
alternative
distribution
channels,
including
physical
retailers
and
online
sales
platforms,\nas
well
as
franchise
dealers.\nWe
have
no
historical
experience
in
selling
or
leasing
vehicles
directly
or
through
alternative
channels,
and
therefore
this
model
may
require
significant
expenditures
and\nprovide
for
slower
expansion
than
the
traditional
dealer
franchise
system.
For
example,
we
will
not
be
able
to
utilize
long
established
sales
channels
developed
through
a
franchise\nsystem
to
increase
sales
volume.
Moreover,
we
will
be
competing
with
companies
with
well
established
distribution
channels.
Our
success
will
depend
in
large
part
on
our
ability
to\neffectively
develop
our
own
sales
channels
and
marketing
strategies.\n29\n',

Document(page_content='Table
of
Contents\nImplementing
a
direct
sales
and
leasing
model
is
subject
to
numerous
significant
challenges,
including
obtaining
permits
and
approvals
from
government
authorities,
and\nwe
may
not
be
successful
in
addressing
these
challenges
in
all
cases.
Further,
there
are
substantial
automotive
franchise
laws
in
place
in
many
geographies
around
the
world
and
we\nmight
be
exposed
to
significant
franchise
dealer
litigation
risks,
which
risks
may
be
further
increased
if
we
ultimately
elect
to
pursue
a
direct
sales
and
leasing
model
in
certain\njurisdictions
in
lieu
of
a
dealer
franchise
model.\nIf
our
direct
sales
and
leasing
model
or
alternative
distribution
channels
do
not
develop
as
expected
or
develop
more
slowly
than
expected,
we
may
be
required
to
modify\nor
abandon
such
models,
which
could
materially
and
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations,
and
cash
flows.\nIn
addition,
a
portion
of
our
distribution
may
be
conducted
under
a
consumer
subscription
model.
A
consumer
subscription
model
is
a
distinct
approach
to
automotive\nsales.
In
a
subscription
model,
we
would
provide
customers
direct
access
to
our
owned
EV
fleet
rather
than
selling
or
leasing
our
EVs
via
direct
sales.
The
subscription
model
of\nvehicle
distribution
is
relatively
new
and
unproven
and
may
provide
for
slower
expansion
than
a
traditional
dealer
franchise
model.
In
addition,
as
the
EVs
in
a
subscription
fleet\nage,
consumers
may
be
unwilling
to
pay
the
same
subscription
price
as
they
are
for
a
new
vehicle,
and
if
we
are
forced
to
discount
our
subscription
prices,
it
may
limit
our
ability
to\nbecome
profitable.
If
consumers
determine
that
there
is
not
a
compelling
reason
to
switch
from
the
traditional
automotive
purchasing
models,
our
subscription
model
may
not\ndevelop
as
expected
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
conduct
sales
through
such
a
model,
which
may
have
an
adverse
impact
on
our
results
of
operations.\nWe
face
legal,
regulatory
and
legislative
uncertainty
in
how
our
go-to-market
models
will
be
interpreted
under
existing
and
future
law
and
we
may
be
required
to
adjust
our\nbusiness
model
in
certain
jurisdictions
as
a
result.\nDirect
sales
models
and
subscription
models
are
each
relatively
novel
in
the
automotive
industry
and
may
be
subject
to
challenge
under
foreign,
federal,
state,
local
or\nmunicipal
laws
or
regulatory
restrictions
in
certain
jurisdictions.
We
may
be
required
to
seek
regulatory
or
policy
changes
to
clarify
uncertainties
in
existing
law
or
to
comply
with\ncertain
existing
state
and
local
laws
and
regulations
regarding
advertising,
sales,
referrals,
contract
and
pricing
disclosures,
delivery
of
EVs
to
consumers,
operating
showrooms,\ndata
collection,
vehicle
tracking,
service
and
repair,
recall
or
other
aspects
of
a
non-traditional
go-to-market
model.
In
addition,
dealer
and
other
trade
associations
may
mount\nchallenges
to
such
a
model
by
challenging
the
legality
of
our
operations
in
court
and
may
undertake
regulatory
and
legislative
efforts
to
propose
laws
that,
if
enacted,
would
prohibit\nor
severely
limit
our
ability
to
operate.
The
application
of
state
laws,
including
the
regulatory
and
legislative
process,
to
our
operations
and
prospect
continues
to
be
difficult
to\npredict.\nIf
we
cannot
overcome
such
legal,
regulatory
and
legislative
barriers
in
certain
jurisdictions,
we
may
be
required
to
adjust
our
consumer
go-to-market
strategies
or\ntimetable
in
order
to
comply
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
such
jurisdictions
or,
in
certain
other
jurisdictions,
we
may
be
prohibited
from
operating
altogether.
For
customers\nresiding
in
any
jurisdictions
in
which
we
will
not
be
allowed
to
market
or
directly
sell
EVs
based
on
our
direct
sales
model
or
a
subscription
model,
as
the
case
may
be,
we
may\nhave
to
arrange
alternate
sales
and
distribution
methods,
or
cease
sales
and
marketing
efforts
altogether.
These
workarounds
could
add
significant
complexity,
and
as
a
result,
costs,\nto
our
business.\nWe
expect
that
we
will
incur
significant
costs
in
defending
our
right
to
operate
in
accordance
with
a
direct
sales
model
or
subscription
model
in
many
jurisdictions,
which\nsubjects
us
to
substantial
risk
as
it
may
provide
for
slower
and
more
costly
expansion
of
our
business
than
may
be
possible
by
utilizing
more
traditional
approaches.
To
the
extent\nthat
efforts
to
block
or
limit
our
operations
are
successful,
or
if
we
are
required
to
comply
with
regulatory
and
other
requirements
applicable
to
vehicle
leasing,
franchise
laws
or\nrental
car
services,
our
revenue
and
growth
would
be
adversely
affected.\nFuture
product
recalls
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nAny
product
recall
in
the
future,
whether
it
involves
our
or
a
competitor’s
product,
may
result
in
negative
publicity,
damage
our
brand
and
materially
adversely
affect
our\nbusiness,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
In
the
future,
we
may
voluntarily
or
involuntarily,
initiate
a
recall
if
any
of
our
EVs
or
any
of
their
parts
prove
to
be\ndefective
or
noncompliant
with
applicable
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards.
These
types
of
disruptions
could
jeopardize
our
ability
to
fulfill
existing
contractual
commitments\nor
satisfy
demand
for
our
EVs
and
could
also
result
in
the
loss
of
business
to
our
competitors.
Such
recalls
also
involve
significant
expense
and
diversion
of
management
attention\nand
other
resources,
which
could
adversely
affect
our
brand
image,
as
well
as
our
business,

If
a
large
number
of
vehicles
are
the
subject
of
a
recall
or
if
needed
replacement
parts
are
not
in
adequate
supply,
we
may
not
be
able
to
repair
and
re-deploy\nrecalled
vehicles
for
a
significant
period
of
time.\nIf
we
are
unable
to
establish
and
maintain
confidence
in
our
long-term
business
prospects
among
customers
and
analysts
and
within
our
industry
or
are
subject
to
negative\npublicity,
then
our
financial
condition,
operating
results,
business
prospects
and
access
to
capital
may
suffer
materially.\nCustomers
may
be
less
likely
to
purchase
our
EVs
if
they
are
not
convinced
that
our
business
will
succeed
or
that
our
service
and
support
and
other
operations
will\ncontinue
in
the
long
term.
Similarly,
suppliers
and
other
third
parties
will
be
less
likely
to
invest
time
and
resources
in
developing
business
relationships
with
us
if
they
are
not\nconvinced
that
our
business
will
succeed.
Accordingly,
in
order
to
build
and
maintain
our
business,
we
must
maintain
confidence
among
customers,
suppliers,
analysts,
ratings\nagencies
and
other
parties
in
our
EVs,
long-term
financial
viability
and
business
prospects.
Maintaining
such
confidence
may
be
particularly
complicated
by
certain
factors\nincluding
those
that
are
largely
outside
of
our
control,
such
as
our
limited
operating
history,
customer
unfamiliarity
with
our
EVs,
any
delays
in
developing
our
manufacturing\nfacilities
and
launching
or
scaling
production
as
well
as
delivery
and
service
operations
to
meet
demand,
competition
and
uncertainty
regarding
the
future
of
hybrid
electric
and\nEVs,
including
our
EVs
and
our
production
and
sales
performance
compared
with
market
expectations.\nWe
have
not
yet
executed
on
our
EV
aftermarket
servicing
and
customer
deployment
of
our
integrated
software.
If
we
or
our
partners
are
unable
to
adequately
service
our\nEVs,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
may
be
materially
and
adversely
affected.\nWe
do
not
yet
have
experience
in
servicing
or
repairing
our
EVs
for
customers.
We
will
launch
of
EV
aftermarket
servicing
and
customer
deployment
of
our
integrated\nsoftware
in
tandem
with
our
first
customer
deliveries.
If
our
we
or
our
partners
do
not
adequately
scale,
it
may
negatively
affect
our
business,
financial
condition
and
operating\nresults.
Additionally,
servicing
EVs
is
different
than
servicing
vehicles
with
internal
combustion
engines
and
requires
specialized
skills,
including
high
voltage
training
and\nservicing
techniques.
We
plan
to
leverage
our
own
service
facilities
or
partner
with
third-parties,
where
possible,
to
perform
some
or
all
of
the
servicing
on
our
EVs,
and
there
can\nbe
no
assurance
that
we
will
be
able
to
enter
into
effective
arrangement
with
any
such
third-party
provider.
Although
such
servicing
partners
may
have
experience
in
servicing
other\nvehicles,
they
will
initially
have
limited
experience
in
servicing
our
vehicles.
There
can
be
no
assurance
that
our
service
arrangements
will
adequately
address
the
service\nrequirements
of
our
customers
to
their
satisfaction,
or
that
we
and
our
servicing
partners
will
have
sufficient
resources,
experience
or
inventory
to
meet
these
service
requirements\nin
a
timely
manner.
Any
continued
global
and
local
disruptions
in
supply
chains,
due
to
the
pandemic
and
other
factors,
may
adversely
affect
our
timely
capacity
to
service
our\nvehicles.
In
addition,
if
we
are
unable
to
roll
out
and
establish
a
widespread
service
network
that
complies
with
applicable
laws,
customer
satisfaction
could
be
adversely
affected,\nwhich
in
turn
could
materially
and
adversely

thus
our
sales,

we
expect
some
Canoo

to
be
packaged
with
the

others
are
expected
to
be
offered
as

as
a\nsubscription

will
depend
on
our
customer
support
team
to
resolve
technical
and
operational
issues
with
respect
to
the
integrated
software
functionality\nunderlying
our
EVs
or
the
additional
functionality
accessed
through
subscription.
We
will
need
to
accurately
predict
service
costs
and
customer
usage
in
order
to
provide
customer\nsupport
and
vehicle
maintenance
in
a
cost-effective
manner.
Customer
behavior
and
usage
may
result
in
higher
than
expected
maintenance
and
repair
costs,
which
may
negatively\naffect
our
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nAs
we
continue
to
grow,
additional
pressure
may
be
placed
on
our
customer
support
team
or
partners,
and
we
may
be
unable
to
respond
quickly
enough
to
accommodate\nshort-term
increases
in
customer
demand
for
technical
support.
We
also
may
be
unable
to
modify
the
future
scope
and
delivery
of
our
technical
support
to
compete
with
changes
in\nthe
technical
support
provided
by
our
competitors.
Increased
customer
demand
for
support,
without
corresponding
revenue,
could
increase
costs
and
negatively
affect
our
operating\nresults.
If

are
unable
to
successfully
address
the
service
requirements
of
our
customers
or
establish
a

perception
that
we
do
not

be\nsubject
to
claims
from
our

including
loss
of

Document(page_content='Table
of
Contents\nOur
customers
may
face
challenges
with
charging
solutions
for
our
EV.\nThe
successful
growth
of
the
EV
market,
including
for
us,
depends
on
the
availability
of
comprehensive
charging
solutions
conveniently
accessible.
We
will
seek
to
reduce\nrange
anxiety
by
designing
our
vehicles
to
be
able
to
use
a
wide
range
of
charging
solutions
and
by
connecting
charging
availability
to
our
mobile
application.
The
success
of
these\nefforts
is
highly
dependent
on
government
and
private
sector
efforts
to
build
out
widely
accessible
charging
infrastructure.
We
have
very
limited
experience
connecting
charging\nsolutions
to
customers
which
is
subject
to
challenges,
including:\n•\nthe
logistics
of
securing
agreements
with
third-party
providers
who
are
rolling
out
and
supporting
networks
of
charging
solutions
in
areas
with
our
customers;\n•\ninadequate
capacity
or
over
capacity
in
certain
areas,
security
risks
or
risk
of
damage
to
vehicles,
the
potential
for
lack
of
customer
acceptance
of
charging
solutions,\nincluding
the
risk
that
customers
may
be
conditioned
to
favor
or
expect
proprietary
charging
solutions;\n•\nthe
building
out
of,
and
access
to,
sufficient
charging
infrastructure;\n•\nexcessive
costs
surpassing
our
estimates
and
expectations;\n•\nobtaining
any
required
permits
for
our
customers
to
access
charging
solutions,
which
may
include
land
use
rights
and
filings;
and\n•\nthe
risk
that
government
support
for
EV
and
alternative
fuel
solutions
and
charging
infrastructure
may
deploy
slower
than
promised
and
may
not
continue.\nWhile
the
prevalence
of
charging
stations
generally
has
been
increasing,
charging
station
locations
are
significantly
less
widespread
than
gas
stations.
Some
potential\ncustomers
may
choose
not
to
purchase
our
vehicles
because
of
the
lack
of
a
more
widespread
charging
infrastructure.
Further,
to
provide
our
customers
with
access
to
sufficient\ncharging
infrastructure,
we
will
rely
on
the
availability
of,
and
successful
integration
of
our
vehicles
with,
third-party
charging
networks.
Any
failure
of
third-party
charging\nnetworks
to
meet
customer
expectations
or
needs,
including
quality
of
experience,
could
impact
the
demand
for
EVs,
including
ours.
For
example,
where
charging
bays
exist,
the\nnumber
of
vehicles
could
oversaturate
the
available
charging
bays,
leading
to
increased
wait
times
and
dissatisfaction
for
customers.
In
addition,
given
our
limited
experience
with\ncharging
solutions,
there
could
be
unanticipated
challenges
which
may
hinder
our
ability
to
connect
customers
to
charging
solutions
or
make
accessing
charging
solutions
costlier\nthan
anticipated.
To
the
extent
we
are
unable
to
meet
user
expectations
or
experience
difficulties
in
connecting
customers
to
charging
solutions,
our
reputation
and
business,\nprospects,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations,
and
cash
flows
may
be
materially
and
adversely
affected.\nInsufficient
reserves
to
cover
warranty
expense,
future
part
replacement
needs
or
other
vehicle
repair
requirements,
including
any
potential
software
upgrades,
could\nmaterially
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nOnce
we
begin
commercial
production
of
our
EVs,
we
will
need
to
maintain
reserves
to
cover
warranty,
part
replacement
and
other
vehicle
repair
needs,
including
any\npotential
software
upgrades
or
warranty
claims.
If
our
reserves
are
inadequate
to
cover
future
warranty
and
maintenance
requirements
on
our
EVs,
our
business,
prospects,
financial\ncondition
and
operating
results
could
be
materially
and
adversely
affected.
We
may
become
subject
to
significant
and
unexpected
expenses
as
well
as
claims
from
our
customers,\nincluding
loss
of
revenue
or
damages.
There
can
be
no
assurance
that
then-existing
reserves
will
be
sufficient
to
cover
all
claims.\nPreorders
for
EVs
are
cancellable.\nOur
EVs
are
still
in
development.
As
a
result,
we
offer
reservations,
or
preorders,
for
our
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
its
variants,
our
Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicles
and
our\nPickup
that
are
cancellable
without
penalty,
including
full
refund
of
any
deposit
payments
(generally
$100
per
vehicle
reserved).
Given
the
anticipated
lead
times
between
preorders\nand
the
date
of
delivery
of
our
EVs,
there
is
a
heightened
risk
that
customers
who
preorder
a
vehicle
may
ultimately
decide
not
to
convert
into
binding
contracts
to
purchase
to
our\nEVs
due
to
potential
changes
in
customer
preferences,
competitive
developments
and
other
factors.
As
a
result,
no
assurance
can
be
made
that
preorders
will
not
be
cancelled
or
that\npreorders\n32\n',

could
harm
our

Related
to
our
Production
Processes
and
Supply
Chain\nIf
we
fail
to
successfully
build
and
tool
our
manufacturing
facilities
or
if
our
manufacturing
facilities
become
inoperable,
we
will
be
unable
to
produce
our
vehicles
and
our\nbusiness
will
be
harmed.\nWe
have
entered
into
facility
leases
for
our
battery
assembly
operations
and
vehicle
manufacturing
operations
in
Pryor,
OK
and
Oklahoma
City,
OK
respectively.\nConstruction
and
tooling
of
our
facilities
for
production
of
our
vehicles
and
our
future
expansion
plans
are
complicated
and
present
significant
challenges.
Among
such
challenges,\nour
launch
plans
contemplate
a
compressed
time
period
between
the
construction
and
tooling
of
our
sites
and
the
start
of
commercial
production.
As
with
any
large-scale
capital\nproject,
our
construction
and
tooling
efforts
could
be
subject
to
delays,
cost
overruns
or
other
complications.
In
order
to
commence
commercial
production
at
our
facilities
in\nOklahoma,
we
will
also
need
to
hire
and
train
a
significant
number
of
employees
and
integrate
a
yet-to-be-fully-developed
supply
chain.
A
failure
to
commence
commercial\nproduction
on
schedule
would
lead
to
additional
costs
and
would
delay
our
ability
to
generate
meaningful
revenues.
In
addition,
it
could
prevent
us
from
gaining
the
confidence
of\npotential
customers,
spur
cancellations
of
reservations
for
our
vehicles
and
open
the
door
to
increased
competition.
All
of
the
foregoing
could
hinder
our
ability
to
successfully\nlaunch
and
grow
our
business
and
achieve
a
competitive
position
in
the
market.\nIn
addition,
there
can
be
no
assurance
that
we
will
be
able
to
establish
each
of
our
planned
production
facilities
within
the
planned
timelines,
or
at
all.
The
expense
and\ntime
required
to
bring
these
facilities
online
and
to
assure
that
EVs
manufactured
at
such
facilities
comply
with
our
quality
standards
and
regulatory
requirements
could
be
greater\nthan
currently
anticipated.
Implementing
our
own
manufacturing
and
production
facilities
increases
our
capital
expenditures
and
could
delay
production
of
our
EVs.
If
we
are\nunable
to
complete
our
facilities
in
accordance
with
our
anticipated
timelines,
we
may
be
unable
to
produce
and
deliver
our
EVs
to
the
market
within
our
planned
timelines.\nIn
addition,
if
any
of
our
manufacturing
facilities
are
not
constructed
in
conformity
with
our
requirements,
repair
or
remediation
may
be
required
to
support
our
planned\nphased
manufacturing
build-out
and
could
require
us
to
take
vehicle
production
offline,
delay
implementation
of
our
planned
phased
manufacturing
build-out,
or
construct
alternate\nfacilities,
which
could
materially
limit
our
manufacturing
capacity,
delay
planned
increases
in
manufacturing
volumes,
or
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
timely
sell
and
deliver
our\nelectric
vehicles
to
customers.
Any
repair
or
remediation
efforts
could
also
require
us
to
bear
substantial
additional
costs,
including
both
the
direct
costs
of
such
activities
and\npotentially
costly
litigation
or
other
legal
proceedings
related
to
any
identified
defect,
and
there
can
be
no
assurance
that
our
insurance
policies
or
other
recoveries
would
be\nsufficient
to
cover
all
or
any
of
such
costs.
Any
of
the
foregoing
consequences
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,
results
of
operations
and
financial\ncondition
and
could
cause
our
results
of
operations
to
differ
materially
from
our
projections.\nWe
may
not
be
able
to
realize
the
non-dilutive
financial
incentives
offered
by
state
and
local
governments
and
other
partners
in
Oklahoma
and
Arkansas.
Developing
our
own\nmanufacturing
facilities
for
production
of
our
EVs
could
increase
our
capital
expenditures
and
delay
or
inhibit
production
of
our
EVs.\nIn
2021
and
2022,
we
finalized
the
selection
of
the
State
of
Oklahoma
as
the
location
for
certain
facilities
for
the
development,
manufacture,
sale
and
service
of
our
EVs.
In\nNovember
2021,
we
finalized
the
selection
of
the
State
of
Arkansas
as
the
location
for
our
corporate
headquarters
and
other
facilities.
As
part
of
the
negotiations
with
the
State
of\nOklahoma
and
the
State
of
Arkansas,
these
States,
as
well
as
local
governments
and
other
partners,
have
offered
non-dilutive
financial
incentives
to
support
our
facilities,
which
we\nexpect
could
be
realized
through
a
period
of
time
based
upon
the
achievement
of
certain
milestones.\nCertain
agreements
with
state

in
Arkansas
and
Oklahoma
remain
preliminary
and
there
is
no
assurance
that
we
will
be
able

and
other
partners
in
Arkansas
and
Oklahoma
to
realize
the\nfull
value
of
the
financial
incentives.
Other
factors
beyond
our
control
could
also
impact
the
ability
of
the

As
a
result,
there
is
no

to
time
and
will
depend
on
repairs
and

resume
operations,
which
may
not
be

Unexpected
malfunctions
of
these

which
may
render
it
difficult

financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nWe
have
delayed
launch
of
our

in
the
past
and
may
delay
in
the
future.
Any
delay
in
the
financing,
design,
development,
production
and
release
of
our
EVs,
could\nmaterially
damage
our
brand,
business,

There
are
often
delays
in
the
design,
development,
production
and
release
of

and
to
the
extent
we
delay
the
launch
of
our

whether
as
a
matter
of
corporate
strategy
or
outside
circumstances,
our
growth
prospects
could
be
adversely
affected
as\nwe
may
fail
to
grow
our
market
share.
In
particular,
if
we
face
challenges
or
delays
in
the
build
out
of
our
manufacturing
operations,
including
initially
our
advanced\nindustrialization
facility
in
Arkansas
and
later
our
mega
microfactory
facility
in
Oklahoma,
we
may
face
potentially
significant
production
delays
which
could
adversely
affect
our\nbusiness.
In
addition,
if
we
are
not
able
to
manufacture
EVs
at
scale
that
meet
our
specifications
on
timelines
required
to
meet
market
demand,
we
may
need
to
expand
our\nmanufacturing
capabilities,
which
could
cause
delays
in
our
vehicle
programs
and
would
cause
us
to
incur
additional
costs.
Furthermore,
we
rely
on
third-party
suppliers
for
the\nprovision
and
development
of
many
of
the
key
components
and
materials
used
in
our
EVs,
and
to
the
extent
they
experience
any
delays,
we
may
need
to
seek
alternative
suppliers.\nIf
we
experience
delays
by
our
suppliers
or
other
third-party
partners,
we
could
experience
delays
in
delivering
on
our
timelines.\nIncreases
in
costs,
disruption
of
supply
or
shortage
of
raw
materials
and
other
components
used
in
our
vehicles,
in
particular
lithium-ion
battery
cells,
could
harm
our
business.\nWe
incur
significant
costs
related
to
procuring
raw
materials
required
to
manufacture
and
assemble
our
vehicles
and
operate
our
business.
The
prices
for
these
raw\nmaterials
fluctuate
depending
on
factors
beyond
our
control
including
market
conditions
and
global
demand
for
these
materials.
Increases
in
prices
could
adversely
affect
our\nbusiness,
prospects,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations,
and
cash
flows.
Further,
any
delays
or
disruptions
in
our

in
the

of
certain
parts,
including
semiconductors
and
other
materials
and
equipment
necessary
for
the
production
of
our
vehicles
and
development
of
our\nmanufacturing
facilities.
Increased
production
of
EVs
by
our
competitors
could
also
result
in
price
fluctuations
and
shortages
of
supply
of
raw
materials
and
components
important\nto
our
business.\nAmong
other
materials,
our
business
depends
on
the
continued
supply
of
lithium
battery
cells
for
our
vehicles.
We
are
exposed
to
multiple
risks
relating
to
such
supply,\nincluding:\n•\nthe
inability
of
battery
cell
manufacturers
to
build
or
operate
battery
cell
manufacturing
plants
to
supply
the
numbers
of
battery
cells
(including
the
applicable\nchemistries)
sufficient
to
support
the
growth
of
the
electric
vehicle
industry
as
demand
for
such
cells
increases;\n•\nan
increase
in
the
cost,
or
decrease
in
the
available
supply,
of
raw
materials
used
in
the
cells;\n•\ndisruption
in
the
supply
of
cells
due
to
quality
issues
or
recalls
by
battery
cell
manufacturers;
and\n•\nfluctuations
in
the
value
of
any
foreign
currencies
in
which
battery
cell
and
related
raw
material
purchases
are
or
may
be
denominated
against
the
U.S.
dollar.\nOur
business
is
dependent
on
the
continued
supply
of
battery
cells
for
the
battery
packs
used
in
our
EVs
and
we
have
contracted
with
Panasonic
for
the
initial
supply
of
our\nbattery
cells.
While
we
are
excited
about
this
partnership,
if
Panasonic
is
unable
to
supply
battery
cells
because
of
shortages
of
raw
materials,
increased
demand
from
other
EV\nmanufacturers,
delays
in
shipping
and
transportation
or
other
factors,
we
could
be
required
to
find
alternative
sources.
We
may
not
be
able
to
find
an
alternative
supplier
in
time
or\nat
all.
Any
disruption
in
our
supply
of
battery
cells
could
disrupt
production
of
our
EVs.\nFurthermore,
fluctuations
or
shortages
in
petroleum
and
other
economic
conditions
may
cause
us
to
experience
significant
increases
in
freight
charges
and
material
costs.\nSubstantial
increases
in
the
prices
for
our
raw
materials
and
components
or
prices
charged
to
us,
such
as
those
charged
by
battery
cell
suppliers,
would
increase
our
operating
costs,\nand
could
reduce
our
margins
if
the
increased
costs
cannot
be
recouped
through
increased
vehicle
prices.
Any
attempts
to
increase
product
prices
in
response
to
increased
material\ncosts
could
result
in
cancellations
of
orders
and
therefore
materially
and
adversely
affect
our
brand,
image,
business,
prospects
and
operating
results.\nWe
depend
upon
third
parties
to
manufacture
and
to
supply
key
semiconductor
chip
components
necessary
for
our
vehicles.
We
do
not
have
long-term
agreements
with
all
of\nour
semiconductor
chip
manufacturers
and
suppliers,
and
if
these
manufacturers
or
suppliers
become
unwilling
or
unable
to
provide
an
adequate
supply
of
semiconductor\nchips,
with
respect
to
which
there
is
a
global
shortage,
we
would
not
be
able
to
find
alternative
sources
in
a
timely
manner
and
our
business
would
be
adversely
impacted.\nSemiconductor
chips
are
a
vital
input
component
to
the
electrical
architecture
of
our
vehicles,
controlling
wide
aspects
of
the
vehicles’
operations.
Due
to
our
reliance
on\nthese
semiconductor
chips,
we
are
subject
to
the
risk
of
shortages
and
long
lead
times
in
their
supply.
We
are
still
in
the
process
of
identifying
alternative
manufacturers
for\nsemiconductor
chips.
We
have
in
the
past
experienced,
and
may
in
the
future
experience,
semiconductor
chip
shortages,
and
the
availability
and
cost
of
these
components
would
be\ndifficult
to
predict.
For
example,
our
manufacturers
may
experience
temporary
or
permanent
disruptions
in
their
manufacturing
operations
due
to
equipment
breakdowns,
labor\nstrikes
or
shortages,
natural
disasters,
component
or
material
shortages,
cost
increases,
acquisitions,
insolvency,
changes
in
legal
or
regulatory
requirements,
or
other
similar\nproblems.\nIn
particular,
continued
increased
demand
for
semiconductor
chips
after
2020,
due
in
part
to
the
COVID-19
pandemic
and
increased
demand
for
consumer
electronics
that\nuse
these
chips,
has
resulted
in
a
severe
global
shortage
of
chips
in
2021
and
2022,
which
we
expect
to
continue
through
2023.
As
a
result,
our
ability
to
source
semiconductor
chips\nused
in
our
vehicles
has
been
adversely
affected.
This
shortage
may
result
in
increased
chip
delivery
lead
times,
delays
in
the
production
of
our
vehicles,
and
increased
costs
to\nsource
available
semiconductor
chips.
To
the
extent
this
semiconductor
chip
shortage
continues,
and
we
are
unable
to
mitigate
the
effects
of
this
shortage,
our
ability
to
deliver\nsufficient
quantities
of
our
vehicles
to
fulfill
our
preorders
and
to
support
our
growth
through
sales
to
new
customers
would
be
adversely
affected.
In
addition,
we
may
be
required\nto
incur
additional
costs
and
expenses
in
managing
ongoing
chip
shortages,
including
additional
research
and
development
expenses,
engineering
design
and
development
costs
in\nthe

business,
which
in
turn\ncould
have
an
adverse
effect
on
our
operations.
Acquired
assets
or
businesses
may
not
generate
the
financial
results
we
expect.
Acquisitions
could
result
in
the
use
of
substantial\namounts
of
cash,
potentially
dilutive
issuances
of
equity
securities,
the
occurrence
of
significant
goodwill
impairment
charges,
amortization
expenses
for
other
intangible
assets
and\nexposure
to
potential
unknown
liabilities
of
the
acquired

Moreover,
the
costs
of

may
be
significant.\nRisks
Related
to
Our
Industry
and
Competitive
Landscape\nThe
automotive
market
is
highly
competitive,
and
we
may
not
be
successful
in
competing
in
this
industry.\nWe
face
intense
competition
in
bringing
our
EVs
to
market.
Both
the
automobile
industry
generally,
and
the
EV
segment
in
particular,
are
highly
competitive,
and
we
will\nbe
competing
for
sales
with
both
EV
manufacturers
and
traditional
automotive
companies.
Many
major
automobile
manufacturers
have
EVs
available
today
and
other
current
and\nprospective
automobile
manufacturers
are
also
developing
EVs.
In
recent
quarters,
interest
in
EVs
from
public
investors
has
made
access
to
public
capital
more
readily
available
for\nnewer
entrants
into
the
EV
market,
which
in
turn
has
increased
the
number
of
viable
competitors.
The
influx
of
new,
well-capitalized
entrants,
some
of
whom
may
be
better\ncapitalized
than
us
or
differently
focused
in
areas
of
the
EV
market
with
greater
demand,
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and\noperating
results.
Many
of
our
current
and
potential
competitors
may
have
significantly
greater
financial,
technical,
manufacturing,
marketing
and
other
resources
than
we
do
and\nmay
be
able
to
devote
greater
resources
to
the
design,
development,
manufacturing,
distribution,
promotion,
sale
and
support
of
their
products,
including
their
EVs.
Additionally,\nmany
of
our
current
and
potential
competitors
may
have
greater
name
recognition,
longer
operating
histories,
larger
sales
forces,
established
servicing
networks
and
broader\ncustomer
and
industry
relationships
and
other
resources
than
we
do.
These
competitors
also
compete
with
us
in
recruiting
and
retaining
qualified
research
and
development,
sales,\nmarketing,
servicing,
software
and
hardware
engineering,
and
management
personnel,
as
well
as
with
investment
opportunities
and
acquiring
technologies
complementary
to,
or\nnecessary
for,
our
EVs.
Additional
mergers
and
acquisitions
may
result
in
even
more
resources
being
concentrated
in
our
competitors.
There
are
no
assurances
that
customers
will\nchoose
our
EVs
over
those
of
our
competitors,
or
over
internal
combustion
engine
vehicles.
We
expect
additional
competitors
will
continue
to
enter
the
industry.
We
also
compete\nwith
companies
offering
automotive
software
products
which
may
be
comparable
or
fall
into
similar
demand
segments
as
our
own.\nWe
expect
competition
in
our
industry
to
continue
to
intensify
based
on
the
current
and
future
competitive
landscape
in
light
of
an
increasing
demand
and
regulatory
push\nfor
alternative
fuel
vehicles
and
EVs.\nIf
the
market
for
EVs
does
not
develop
as
we
expect
or
develops
more
slowly
than
is
expected,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
will
be\nadversely
affected.\nOur
growth
is
highly
dependent
upon
the
adoption
by
consumers
and
commercial
fleets
of
EVs,
the
timely
functioning
of
global
and
localized
supply
chains,
and
the\npublic
and
private
build
out
of
EV
charging
infrastructure.
The
target
demographics
for
our
EVs
are
highly
competitive.
If
the
market
for
EVs
does
not
develop
at
the
rate
or
in
the\nmanner
or
to
the
extent
that
we
expect,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
will
be
harmed.
The
market
for
alternative
fuels,
hybrid
and
EVs
is
new
and\nuntested
and
is
characterized
by
rapidly
changing
technologies,\n37\n',

market
for

and
as
a
result,
the

could
be
affected
by
numerous
factors,
such
as:\n•\nperceptions
about

about
the

including
from

or
other
factors;
and\n•\nperceptions
of
overall
EV
vehicle
safety,
such
as
those
relating
to
battery
combustibility.\nThe
demand
for
EVs
depends,
in
part,
on
the
continuation
of
current
trends
resulting
from
dependence
on
fossil
fuels.
Extended
periods
of
low
gasoline
or
other
petroleum-\nbased
fuel
prices
could
adversely
affect
demand
for
our
EVs,
which
would
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nWe
believe
that
much
of
the
present
and
projected
demand
for
EVs
results
from
concerns
about
volatility
in
the
cost
of
gasoline
and
other
petroleum-based
fuel,
the\ndependency
of
the
United
States
on
oil
from
unstable
or
hostile
countries,
government
regulations
and
economic
incentives
promoting
fuel
efficiency
and
alternative
forms
of\nenergy,
as
well
as
the
belief
that
climate
change
results
in
part
from
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels.
If
the
cost
of
gasoline
and
other
petroleum-based
fuel
decreased
significantly,
the\noutlook
for
the
long-term
supply
of
oil
to
the
United
States
improved,
the
government
eliminated
or
modified
our
regulations
or
economic
incentives
related
to
fuel
efficiency
and\nalternative
forms
of
energy,
or
if
there
is
a
change
in
the
perception
that
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
negatively
impacts
the
environment,
the
demand
for
EVs
could
be
reduced,
and\nour
business
and
revenue
may
be
harmed.\nGasoline
and
other
petroleum-based
fuel
prices
have
been
extremely
volatile,
and
we
believe
this
continuing
volatility
will
persist.
Lower
gasoline
or
other
petroleum-\nbased
fuel
prices
over
extended
periods
of
time
may
lower
the
perception
in
government
and
the
private
sector
that
cheaper,
more
readily
available
energy
alternatives
should
be\ndeveloped
and
produced.
If
gasoline
or
other
petroleum-based
fuel
prices
remain
at
deflated
levels
for
extended
periods
of
time,
the
demand
for
EVs
may
decrease,
which
would\nhave
an
adverse

on
our

Further,

difficult.
Therefore,

can
be

use
of
lithium-ion
battery
cells,
which
have
been
observed
to
catch
fire
or
vent
smoke
and
flame.\nThe
battery
packs
in
our
EVs
use
lithium-ion
cells.
On
rare
occasions,
lithium-ion
cells
can
rapidly
release
the
energy
they
contain
by
venting
smoke
and
flames
in
a\nmanner
that
can
ignite
nearby
materials
as
well
as
other
lithium-ion
cells.
While
we
have
taken
measures
to
enhance
the
safety
of
our
battery
designs,
a
field
or
testing
failure
of
our\nEVs
could
occur
in
the
future,
which
could
subject
us
to
lawsuits,
product
recalls,
or
redesign
efforts,
all
of
which
would
be
time-consuming
and
expensive.
Also,
negative
public\nperceptions
regarding
the
suitability
of
lithium-ion
cells
for
automotive
applications
or
any
future
incident
involving
lithium-ion
cells
such
as
a
vehicle
or
other
fire,
even
if
such\nincident
does
not
involve
our
EVs,
could
seriously
harm
our
business.\nIn
addition,
we
and
certain
of
our
third
party
partners
and
suppliers
are
expected
to
store
a
significant
number
of
lithium-ion
cells
at
their
facilities.
Any
mishandling
of\nbattery
cells
may
cause
disruption
to
the
operation
of
such
facilities.
A
safety
issue
or
fire
related
to
the
cells
could
disrupt
operations
or
cause
manufacturing
delays.
Such
damage\nor
injury
could
lead
to
adverse
publicity
and
potentially
a
safety
recall.
Moreover,
any
failure
of
a
competitor’s
EV
or
energy
storage
product
may
cause
indirect
adverse
publicity\nfor
us
and
our
EVs.
Such
adverse
publicity
could
negatively
affect
our
brand
and
harm
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\n43\n',

and
others\nof
security
breaches
involving
certain
types
of

may
be
inconsistent

In
the
United
States,
California
adopted
the
California
Consumer
Privacy
Act
(“CCPA”),
which\nbecame
effective
in
January
2020.
The
CCPA
establishes
a
privacy
framework
for
covered
businesses,
including
an
expansive
definition
of
personal
information
and
data
privacy\nrights
for
California
residents.
The
CCPA
includes
a
framework
with
potentially
severe
statutory
damages
and
private
rights
of
action
for
data
breaches.
Specifically,
the
CCPA\nrequires
covered
businesses
to
provide
new
disclosures
to
California
residents,
provide
them
new
ways
to
opt-out
of
the
sale
of
personal
information.
The
CCPA
provides
for
civil\npenalties
for
violations
and
statutory
damages
ranging
from
$100
to
$750
per
violation,
which
is
expected
to
increase
data
breach
class
action
litigation
and
result
in
exposure
to\ncostly
legal
judgments
and
settlements.
The
CCPA
was
expanded
on
January
1,
2023,
when
the
California
Privacy
Rights
Act
(“CPRA”)
becomes
operative.
The
CPRA,
among\nother
things,
gave
California
residents
the
ability
to
limit
the
use
of
certain
sensitive
personal
information,
further
restricted
the
use
of
cross-contextual
advertising,
establish\nrestrictions
on
the
retention
of
personal
information,
expanded
the
types
of
data
breaches
subject
to
the
CCPA’s
private
right
of
action,
provide
for
increased
penalties
for
CPRA\nviolations
concerning
California
residents
under
the
age
of
16,
and
established
a
new
California
Privacy
Protection
Agency
to
implement
and
enforce
California’s
privacy
laws.
As\nwe
expand
our
operations,
the
CCPA
may
increase
our
compliance
costs
and
potential
liability.
Some
observers
have
noted
that
the
CCPA
marks
the
beginning
of
a
trend
toward\nmore
stringent
privacy
legislation
in
the
United
States,
evidenced
by
new
privacy
laws
that
have
become
effective
in
Utah,
Virginia,
Colorado
and
Connecticut.
Other
states
have\nbegun
to
propose
or
enact
similar
laws.\nIn
Europe,
the
General
Data
Protection
Regulation
(EU)
2016/679
(GDPR),
applies
across
the
European
Economic
Area
(EEA).
Also,
notwithstanding
the
United\nKingdom's
(UK)
withdrawal
from
the
European
Union,
by
operation
of
the
so-called
“UK
GDPR,”
the
GDPR
continues
to
apply
in
substantially
equivalent
form
in
the
context
of\nUK-focused
personal
data
processing
operations.
Collectively,
European
data
protection
laws
(including
the
GDPR)
are
wide-ranging
in
scope
and
impose
numerous,
significant\nand
complex
compliance
burdens
in
relation
to
the
processing
of
personal
data
such
as,
without
limitation,
with
regard
the
international
transfer
of
personal
data
out
of
the
European\nEconomic
Area,
Switzerland
and
United
Kingdom.
European
data
protection
laws
also
provide
for
more
robust
regulatory
enforcement
and
greater
penalties
for
noncompliance\nthan
previous
data
protection
laws,
including,
for
example,
under
the
GDPR,
fines
of
up
to
€20
million
or
4%
of
global
annual
revenue
of
any
noncompliant
organization
for
the\npreceding
financial
year,
whichever
is
higher.
The
GDPR
also
confers
regulators
with
the
ability
to
impose
personal
data
processing
penalties;
and
a
private
right
of
action
for
data\nsubjects
and
consumer
associations
to
lodge
complaints
with
supervisory
authorities,
seek
judicial
remedies,
as
well
as
obtain
compensation
for
damages
resulting
from
violations\nof
the
GDPR.\n45\n"",

Future
guidance
from
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(the
“IRS”)
with
respect
to
the
Tax
Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
(the
""Tax
Act"")
may\naffect
us,
and
certain
aspects
of
the
Tax
Act
could
be
repealed
or
modified
in
future
legislation.
The
CARES
Act
has
already
modified
certain
provisions
of
the
Tax
Act.
In
addition,\nit
is
uncertain
if
and
to
what
extent
various
states
will
conform
to
the
Tax
Act,
the
CARES
Act
or
any
newly
enacted
federal
tax
legislation.
Changes
in
corporate
tax
rates,
the\nrealization
of
net
deferred
tax
assets
relating
to
our
operations
and
the
deductibility
of
expenses
under
the
Tax
Act
or
future
reform
legislation
could
have
a
material
impact
on
the\nvalue
of
our
deferred
tax
assets,
could
result
in
significant
one-time
charges,
and
could
increase
our
future
U.S.
tax
expense.\nOur
ability
to
use
net
operating
loss
carryforwards
and
other
tax
attributes
may
be
limited.\nWe
have
incurred
U.S.
losses
during
our
history
and
do
not
expect
to
become
profitable
in
the
near
future
and
may
never
achieve
profitability.
To
the
extent
that
we\ncontinue
to
generate
U.S.
taxable
losses,
unused
losses
will
carry
forward
to
offset
future
taxable
income,
if
any,
until
such
unused
losses
expire,
if
at
all.\nUnder
the
Tax
Act,
as
modified
by
the
CARES
Act,
U.S.
federal
net
operating
loss
carryforwards
generated
in
taxable
periods
beginning
after
December
31,
2017,
may
be\ncarried
forward
indefinitely,
but
the
deductibility
of
such
net
operating
loss
carryforwards
in
taxable
years
beginning
after
December
31,
2020,
is
limited
to
80%
of
taxable
income.\nIt
is
uncertain
if
and
to
what
extent
various
states
will
conform
to
the
Tax
Act
or
the
CARES
Act.\nIn
addition,
the
U.S.
net
operating
loss
carryforwards
are
subject
to
review
and
possible
adjustment
by
the
IRS,
and
state
tax
authorities.

in
the
event
of
certain
cumulative
changes
in
our
ownership.
An\n“ownership
change”
pursuant
to
Section
382
of
the
Code
generally
occurs
if
one
or
more
stockholders
or
groups
of
stockholders
who
own
at
least
5%
of
a
company’s
stock\nincrease
their
ownership
by
more
than
50
percentage
points
over
their
lowest
ownership
percentage
within
a
rolling
three-year
period.
The
ability
to
utilize
net
operating
loss\ncarryforwards
and
other
tax
attributes
to
offset
future
taxable
income
or
tax
liabilities
may
be
limited
as
a
result
of
ownership
changes.
Similar
rules
may
apply
under
state
tax
laws.\nWe
determined
that
an
ownership
change
occurred
during
the
2021
tax
year,
resulting
in
an
annual
limitation
under
Section
382.
If
we
earn
taxable
income,
such
limitation
could\nresult
in
increased
future
income
tax
liability
to
us
and
our
future
cash
flows
could
be
adversely
affected.
We
have
recorded
a
full
valuation
allowance
related
to
our
net
operating\nloss
carryforwards
and
other
deferred
tax
assets
due
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
ultimate
realization
of
the
future
benefits
of
those
assets.\nThe
imposition
of
tariffs
and
the
resulting
consequences,
could
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nOur
business
is
subject
to
risks
relating
to
the
imposition
of
tariffs
and
other
trade
barriers,
which
may
make
it
more
costly
for
us
to
import
certain
raw
materials
and
other\ncomponents
and,
in
the
future,
export
our
EVs.
In
recent
years,
the
U.S.
government
has
imposed
tariffs
on
certain
foreign
goods,
including
steel
and
certain
vehicle
parts,
which\nhave
begun
to
result
in
increased
costs
for
goods
imported
into
the
United
States.
In
response
to
these
tariffs,
a
number
of
U.S.
trading
partners
have
imposed
retaliatory
tariffs
on
a\nwide
range
of
U.S.
products,
which
makes
it
more
costly
for
us
to
export
our
EVs
to
those
countries.
If
we
are
unable
to
pass
price
increases
on
to
our
customer
base
or
otherwise\nmitigate
the
costs,
or
if
demand
for
our
exported
EVs,
if
any,
decreases
due
to
the
higher
cost,
our
operating
results
could
be
materially
adversely
affected.
In
addition,
further
tariffs\nmay
be
proposed
at
any
time
by
the
U.S.
and
our
trading
partners,
as
response
to
various
geopolitical
events,
and
additional
trade
restrictions
could
be
implemented
on
a
broader\nrange
of
products
or
raw
materials.
The
resulting
environment
of
tariffs,
trade
restrictions
or
other
practices
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,\nfinancial
condition,
operating
results,
customers,
suppliers
and
the
global
economy.\nWe
are
subject
to
governmental
export
and
import
controls
and
laws
that
could
subject
us
to
liability
if
we
are
not
in
compliance
with
such
laws.\nOur
EVs
are
subject
to
export
control,
import
and
economic
sanctions
laws
and
regulations,
including
the
U.S.
Export
Administration
Regulations,
U.S.
Customs\nregulations
and
various
economic
and
trade
sanctions
regulations
administered
by
the
U.S.
Treasury
Department’s
Office
of
Foreign
Assets
Control.
Exports
of
our
EVs
and\ntechnology
must
be
made
in
compliance
with
these
laws
and
regulations.
If
we
fail
to
comply
with
these
laws
and
regulations,
we
and
certain
of
our
employees
could
be
subject
to\nsubstantial
civil
or
criminal
penalties,
including
the
possible
loss
of
export
or
import
privileges;
fines,
which
may
be
imposed
on
us
and
responsible
employees
or
managers;
and,
in\nextreme
cases,
the
incarceration
of
responsible
employees
or
managers.\nIn
addition,
changes
to
our
EVs,
or
changes
in
applicable
export
control,
import,
or
economic
sanctions
laws
and
regulations
may
create
delays
in
the
introduction
and
sale\nof
our
EVs
and
solutions
or,
in
some
cases,
prevent
the
export
or
import
of
our
EVs
to
certain
countries,
governments,
or
persons
altogether.
Any
change
in
export,
import,
or\neconomic
sanctions
laws
and
regulations,
shift
in
the
enforcement
or
scope
of
existing
laws
and
regulations,
or
change
in
the
countries,
governments,
persons,
or
technologies\ntargeted
by
such
laws
and

could
also
result
in
decreased
use
of
our
EVs,
as
well
as
our
decreased
ability
to
export
or

our
EVs
to
potential
customers.
Any\ndecreased
use
of
our

or
limitation
on
our

would
likely
adverse
our

of

anti-corruption
and

regulations.
We
can
face
criminal
liability

approximately
13.82%
of
our
outstanding
Common
Stock.
As
a\nresult,
these
stockholders
are
able
to
exercise
a
significant
level
of
control
over
all
matters
requiring
stockholder
approval,
including
the
election
of
directors,
amendment
of
our\nCertificate
of
Incorporation
and
approval
of
significant
corporate
transactions.
This
control
could
have
the
effect
of
delaying
or
preventing
a
change
of
control
of
us
or
changes
in\nmanagement
and
will
make
the
approval
of
certain
transactions
difficult
or
impossible
without
the
support
of
these
stockholders.\nWe
have
been
notified
by
The
Nasdaq
Stock
Market
LLC
of
our
failure
to
comply
with
certain
continued
listing
requirements
and,
if
we
are
unable
to
regain
compliance
with\nall
applicable
continued
listing
requirements
and
standards
of
Nasdaq,
our
Common
Stock
could
be
delisted
from
Nasdaq,
which
would
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
trading,\nliquidity,
and
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock.\nOn
March
27,
2023,
we
received
a
written
notice
from
the
Listing
Qualifications
Department
of
The
Nasdaq
Stock
Market
LLC
(“Nasdaq”)
indicating
that,
because
the\nclosing
bid
price
for
our
Common
Stock
has
fallen
below
$1.00
per
share
for
30
consecutive
business
days
(February
9,
2023
through
March
24,
2023),
we
no
longer
comply
with\nthe
$1.00
Minimum
Bid
Price
requirement
set
forth
in
Nasdaq
Listing
Rule
5450(a)(1)
for
continued
listing
on
The
Nasdaq
Global
Select
Market
(the
“Bid
Price
Requirement”).\nPursuant
to
Nasdaq
Marketplace
Rule
5810(c)(3)(A),
we
have
been
provided
with
a
compliance
period
of
180
calendar
days,
or
until
September
25,
2023,
to
regain
compliance
with\nthe
Bid
Price
Requirement.
To
regain
compliance,
the
closing
bid
price
of
our
Common
Stock
must
meet
or
exceed
$1.00
per
share
for
a
minimum
of
ten
consecutive
business
days\nprior
to
September
25,
2023.\nIf
we
do
not
regain
compliance
by
September
25,
2023,
we
may
be
eligible
for
an
additional
grace
period.
To
qualify,
we
must
apply
to
transfer
the
listing
of
our
Common\nStock
to
The
Nasdaq
Capital
Market,
which
requires
us
to
meet
the
continued
listing
requirements
for
market
value
of
publicly
held
shares
and
all
other
initial
listing
standards
for\nThe
Nasdaq
Capital
Market,
with
the
exception
of
the
Bid
Price
Requirement,
and
provide
written
notice
of
our
intention
to
cure
the
minimum
bid
price
deficiency
during
the\nsecond
compliance
period.
If
we
meet
these
requirements,
the
Nasdaq
staff
would
be
expected
to
grant
an
additional
180
calendar
days
for
the
Company
to
regain
compliance
with\nthe
minimum
bid
price
requirement.
If
the
Nasdaq
staff
determines
that
we
will
not
be
able
to
cure
the
deficiency,
or
if
we
are
otherwise
not
eligible
for
such
additional
compliance\nperiod,
Nasdaq
will
provide
notice
that
our
Common
Stock
will
be
subject
to
delisting.
The
Company
would
have
the
right
to
appeal
a
determination
to
delist
its
common
stock,
and\nthe
common
stock
would
remain
listed
on
the
Nasdaq
Global
Select
Market
until
the
completion
of
the
appeal
process.\nAlthough
we
intend
to
continue
to
monitor
the
bid
price
levels
for
our
Common
Stock
and
will
consider
appropriate
alternatives
to
achieve
compliance
with
the
Bid
Price\nRequirement
within
the
compliance
period,
including,
among
other
things,
a
potential
reverse
stock
split,
we
cannot
assure
you
that
the
price
of
our
Common
Stock
will\nsubsequently
remain
in
compliance
with
the
required
listing
standard
or
that
we
will
remain
in
compliance
with
any
of
the
other
applicable
continued
listing
standards
of
Nasdaq.\nAny
continuing
failure
to
remain
in
compliance
with
Nasdaq's
continued
listing
standards,
and
any
subsequent
failure
to
timely
resume
compliance
with
Nasdaq's
continued
listing\nstandards
within
the
applicable
cure
period,
could
have
adverse
consequences
including,
among
others,
reducing
the
number
of
investors
willing
to
hold
or
acquire
our
Common\nStock,
reducing
the
liquidity
and
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock,
adverse
publicity
and
a
reduced
interest
in
us
from
investors,
analysts
and
other
market
participants.
If
we
are\ndelisted
from
Nasdaq,
our
Common
Stock
may
be
eligible
for
trading
on
an
over-the-counter
market.
If
the
Company
is
not
able
to
obtain
a
listing
on
another
stock
exchange
or\nquotation
service
for
its
common
stock,
it
may
be
extremely
difficult
or
impossible
for
stockholders
to
sell
their
shares
of
Common
Stock.
Moreover,
if
the
Company
is
delisted\nfrom
Nasdaq,
but
obtains
a
substitute
listing
for
its
Common
Stock,
it
will
potentially
be
on
a
market
with
less
liquidity,
and
therefore
experience
potentially
more
price
volatility\nthan
experienced
on
Nasdaq.
Stockholders
may
not
be
able
to
sell
their
shares
of
Common
Stock
on
any
such
substitute
market
in
the
quantities,
at
the
times,
or
at
the
prices
that\ncould
potentially
be
available
on
a
more
liquid
trading
market.
As
a
result
of
these
factors,
if
the
Company’s
Common
Stock
is
delisted
from
Nasdaq,
the
value
and
liquidity
of
the\nCompany’s
Common
Stock
would
likely
be
significantly
adversely
affected.
A
delisting
of
the
Company’s
common
stock
from
Nasdaq
could
also
adversely
affect
the
Company’s\nability
to
obtain
financing
for
its
operations
and/or
could
result
in
a
loss
of
confidence
by
investors,
employees
and/or
business
partners.\n49\n"",

which
may
never
occur,
as
the
only
way

realize

stock
price
has
been
volatile,
and
the
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock
may
drop
below
the
price
you
pay.\nSecurities
markets
worldwide
have
experienced,
and
are
likely
to
continue
to
experience,
significant
price
and
volume
fluctuations.
This
market
volatility,
as
well
as\ngeneral
economic,
market
or
political
conditions,
has
subjected
the
market
price
of
our
shares
to
wide
price
fluctuations
regardless
of
our
operating

The
market
price\nof
our
common

significantly
in

to
a

of
factors,
many
of
which
we
cannot

addition,
in

past,
when
the

has
been
volatile,

of
that

have
sometimes
instituted
securities
class
action
litigation
against
the\nCompany

the

If
any
of
our
stockholders
brought
a
lawsuit
against
us,
we
could
incur
substantial
costs
defending
the
lawsuit.
Such
a
lawsuit
could
also
divert
the\ntime
and
attention
of
our
management
from
our
business,
which
could
significantly
harm
our
profitability
and
reputation.\nOur

addition,
the
enforceability
of
similar
exclusive
forum
provisions
in
other
companies’
certificates
of
incorporation
has
been
challenged
in
legal
proceedings,
and
it
is\npossible
that,
in
connection
with
one
or
more
actions
or
proceedings
described
above,
a
court
could
rule
that
this
provision
in
our
Certificate
of
Incorporation
is
inapplicable
or\nunenforceable.
In
March
2020,
the
Delaware
Supreme
Court
issued
a
decision
in
Salzburg
et
al.
v.
Sciabacucchi,
which
found
that
an
exclusive
forum
provision
providing
for\nclaims
under
the
Securities
Act
to
be
brought
in
federal
court
is
facially
valid
under
Delaware
law.
We
intend
to
enforce
this
provision,
but
we
do
not
know
whether
courts
in
other\njurisdictions
will
agree
with
this
decision
or
enforce
it.
If
a
court
were
to
find
the
exclusive
forum
provision
contained
in
our
Certificate
of
Incorporation
to
be
inapplicable
or\nunenforceable
in
an
action,
we
may
incur
additional
costs
associated
with
resolving
such
action
in
other
jurisdictions,
which
could
harm
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition\nand
operating
results.\nThe
issuance
of
shares
of
our
Common
Stock
upon
exercise
of
our
outstanding
Public
Warrants
will
increase
the
number
of
shares
eligible
for
future
resale
in
the
public\nmarket
and
result
in
dilution
to
our
stockholders.\nAs
of
December
31,
2022,
warrants
to
purchase
an
aggregate
of
approximately
23.8
million
shares
of
our
Common
Stock
were
outstanding
and
exercisable
(subject
to
the\nconditions
set
forth
in
the
Public
Warrant
Agreement)
(such
warrants,
""Public
Warrants"").
The
exercise
price
of
these
Public
Warrants
is
$11.50
per
share.
To
the
extent
such
Public\nWarrants
are
exercised,
additional
shares
of
our
Common
Stock
will
be
issued,
which
will
result
in
dilution
to
the
holders
of
our
Common
Stock
and
increase
the
number
of
shares\neligible
for
resale
in
the
public
market.
Sales
of
substantial
numbers
of
such
shares
in
the
public
market
or
the
fact
that
such
Public
Warrants
may
be
exercised
could
adversely\naffect
the
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock.\nThere
is
no
guarantee
that
our
Public
Warrants
will
be
in
the
money
at
the
time
they
are
exercisable,
and
they
may
expire
worthless.\nThe
exercise
price
for
our
Public
Warrants
is
$11.50
per
share
of
Common
Stock.
There
is
no
guarantee
that
the
Public
Warrants
will
be
in
the
money
throughout
the
time\nthey
are
exercisable
and
prior
to
their
expiration,
and
as
such,
the
Public
Warrants
may
expire
worthless.\nWe
may
amend
the
terms
of
the
Public
Warrants
in
a
manner
that
may
be
adverse
to
holders
with
the
approval
by
the
holders
of
at
least
50%
of
the
then-outstanding\nPublic
Warrants.
As
a
result,
the
exercise
price
of
your
Public
Warrants
could
be
increased,
the
exercise
period
could
be
shortened
and
the
number
of
shares
of
our
Common
Stock\npurchasable
upon
exercise
of
a
Public
Warrant
could
be
decreased,
all
without
your
approval.\nOur
Public
Warrants
are
issued
in
registered
form
under
a
warrant
agreement
(the
“Public
Warrant
Agreement”)
between
us
and
Continental
Stock
Transfer
&
Trust\nCompany,
as
warrant
agent.
The
Public
Warrant
Agreement
provides
that
the
terms
of
the
Public
Warrants
may
be
amended
without
the
consent
of
any
holder
to
cure
any\nambiguity
or
correct
any
defective
provision,
but
requires
the
approval
by
the
holders
of
at
least
50%
of
the
then-outstanding
Public
Warrants
to
make
any
change
that
adversely\naffects
the
interests
of
the
registered
holders
of
Public
Warrants.
Accordingly,
we
may
amend
the
terms
of
the
Public
Warrants
in
a
manner
adverse
to
a
holder
if
holders
of
at
least\n50%
of
the
then-outstanding
Public
Warrants
approve
of
such
amendment.
Although
our
ability
to
amend
the
terms
of
the
public
warrants
with
the
consent
of
at
least
50%
of
the\nthen-outstanding
Public
Warrants
is
unlimited,
examples
of
such
amendments
could
be
amendments
to,
among
other
things,
increase
the
exercise
price
of
the
Public
Warrants,\nconvert
the
Public
Warrants
into
cash
or
stock
(at
a
ratio
different
than
initially
provided),
shorten
the
exercise
period
or
decrease
the
number
of
shares
of
our
Common
Stock\npurchasable
upon
exercise
of
a
Public
Warrant.\nWe
may
redeem
unexpired
Public
Warrants
prior
to
their
exercise
at
a
time
that
is
disadvantageous
to
warrant
holders,
thereby
making
such
Public
Warrants
worthless.\nWe
have
the
ability
to
redeem
outstanding
Public
Warrants
at
any
time
after
they
become
exercisable
and
prior
to
their
expiration,
at
a
price
of
$0.01
per
warrant,
provided\nthat
the

face
various
risks
related
to
public
health
issues,
including
epidemics,
pandemics
and
other
outbreaks.
For
instance,
the
COVID-19
pandemic
previously
resulted
in\ngovernment
authorities
implementing
numerous
measures
to
try
to
contain
the
virus,
such
as
travel
bans
and
restrictions,
quarantines,
social
distancing
practices,
stay-at-home
or\nshelter-in-place
orders,
and
business
shutdowns.
These
measures
had
an
adverse
impact
on

business
and

including,
for
example,
inefficiencies
with
testing
and\nmanufacturing
of
our
EVs,
which

increased

of
our
senior
officers
have
limited
experience
in
the
management
of
a
publicly

Such
members’
limited
experience
could
expose

to
risks,\nespecially
with
respect
to
the
application
and
interpretation
of

or

over

We
continue\nto
upgrade

an
enterprise
system

will
assist

our
filings
with
the
SEC
may
be
delayed

we
may
suffer
errors
with
respect
to
our\ninternal
control
over
financial
reporting
or
otherwise
with
respect
to
our
public
filings,
some
of
which
could
be
material
errors
or
result
in
claims
of
fraud
or
misrepresentation.\nWe
incur
increased
costs
and
administrative
burden
as
a
result
of
operating
as
a
public
company,
and
our
management
devotes
substantial
time
to
maintaining
compliance.\nAs
a
public
company,
we
incur
significant
legal,
accounting
and
other
expenses
that
we
did
not
incur
as
a
private
company,
and
these
expenses
may
increase
even
more\nnow
that
we
are
no
longer
an
emerging
growth
company.
As
a
public
company,
we
are
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
Exchange
Act,
the
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act,
the
Dodd-Frank\nWall
Street
Reform
and
Consumer
Protection
Act
of
2010,
and
the
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
and
to
be
promulgated
thereunder,
Public
Company
Accounting
Oversight\nBoard
(the
“PCAOB”),
as
well
as
rules
adopted,
and
to
be
adopted,
by
the
SEC
and
Nasdaq.
Our
management
and
other
personnel
devote
a
substantial
amount
of
time
to\nmaintaining
compliance
with
these
requirements,
Moreover,
these
rules
and
regulations
substantially
increase
our
legal
and
financial
compliance
costs
and
make
some
activities\nmore
time-consuming
and
costly.
The
increased
costs
may
increase
our
net
loss
and
comprehensive
loss.\nIt
may
also
be
more
expensive
to
obtain
director
and
officer
liability
insurance.
We
cannot
always
predict
or
estimate
the
amount
or
timing
of
additional
costs
it
may
incur\nto
respond
to
these
requirements.
The
impact
of
these
requirements
could
also
make
it
more
difficult
for
us
to
attract
and
retain
qualified
persons
to
serve
on
our
board
of
directors,\nour
board
committees
or
as
executive
officers.
The
additional
reporting
and
other
obligations
imposed
by
these
rules
and
regulations
may
increase
legal
and
financial
compliance\ncosts
and
the
costs
of
related
legal,
accounting
and
administrative
activities.
These
increased
costs
may
require
us
to
divert
a
significant
amount
of
money
that
could
otherwise
be\nused
to
expand
the
business
and
achieve
strategic
objectives.
Furthermore,
if
any
issues
in
complying
with
the
above
requirements
are
identified
(for
example,
if
we
or
our\nindependent
registered
public
accounting
firm
identifies
additional
material
weaknesses
or
significant
deficiency
in
the
internal
control
over
financial
reporting),
we
could
incur\nadditional
costs
rectifying
those
issues,
and
the
existence
of
those
issues
could
adversely
affect
our
reputation
or
investor
perceptions
of
it.
Advocacy
efforts
by
stockholders
and\nthird
parties
may
also
prompt
additional
changes
in
governance
and
reporting
requirements,
which
could
further
increase
costs.\n54\n',

scrutiny
of
our
environmental,
social
or

responsibilities
have
and
will
likely
continue
to
result
in
additional
costs
and
risks,
and
may
adversely\nimpact
our
reputation,
employee
retention,
and
willingness
of
customers
and
suppliers
to
do
business
with
us.\nThere
is
increasing
focus
from
customers,
consumers,
employees,
regulators,
lenders
and
other
stakeholders
concerning
environmental,
social
and
governance
(“ESG”)\nmatters,
including
corporate
citizenship
and
sustainability.
Additionally,
public
interest
and
legislative
pressure
related
to
public
companies'
ESG
practices
continues
to
grow.
If
our\nESG
practices
fail
to
meet
regulatory
requirements
or
stakeholders'
evolving
expectations
and
standards
for
responsible
corporate
citizenship
in
areas
including
environmental\nstewardship,
support
for
local
communities,
Board
and
employee
diversity,
human
capital
management,
employee

and
safety
practices,
corporate
governance
and\ntransparency
and
employing
ESG
strategies
in
our
operations,
our
brand,
reputation
and
employee
retention
may
be
negatively
impacted,
and
customers
and
suppliers
may
be\nunwilling
to
do
business
with
us.\nApplying
ESG
approaches
in
our
manufacturing,
servicing
and
other
processes
is
likely
to
incur
additional
costs,
with
growing
regulatory
requirements
and
market\ndemand
for
the
inclusion
of
more
ESG
compliant
options
in
construction,
manufacturing,
waste
processing
and
supply
chains.\nIn
addition,
as
we
work
to
align
our
ESG
practices
with
industry
standards,
we
have
expanded
and,
in
the
future,
will
likely
continue
to
expand
our
public
disclosure
in\nthese
areas.
From
time
to
time,
we
may
communicate
certain
initiatives
or
goals
regarding
environmental
and
sustainability
topics
and
other
ESG
matters
either
through
disclosures\nin
our
public
filings
or
documents
that
we
publish
on
our
website.
In
the
U.S.,
amongst
other
regulatory
efforts,
in
February
2021,
the
Acting
Chair
of
the
SEC
issued
a
statement\ndirecting
the
Division
of
Corporation
Finance
to
enhance
its
focus
on
climate-related
disclosure
in
public
company
filings,
and
in
March
2021,
the
SEC
announced
the
creation
of
a\nClimate
and
ESG
Task
Force
in
the
Division
of
Enforcement.
We
expect
to
incur
additional
costs
and
require
additional
resources
to
monitor,
report
and
comply
with
regulatory\nrequirements
and
our
own-developed
ESG
practices.
The
standards
for
tracking
and
reporting
on
ESG
matters
are
relatively
new,
have
not
been
harmonized
and
continue
to
evolve.\nThe
disclosure
frameworks
we
choose
to
align
with,
if
any,
may
change
from
time
to
time
and
may
result
in
a
lack
of
consistent
or
meaningful
comparative
data
from
period
to\nperiod.
Ensuring
there
are
systems
and
processes
in
place
to
comply
with
various
ESG
tracking
and
reporting
obligations
will
require
management
time
and
expense.
In
addition,\nour
processes
and
controls
may
not
always
comply
with
evolving
standards
for
identifying,
measuring,
and
reporting
ESG
metrics,
our
interpretation
of
reporting
standards
may\ndiffer
from
those
of
others
and
such
standards
may
change
over
time,
any
of
which
could
result
in
significant
revisions
to
our
goals
or
reported
progress
in
achieving
such
goals.\nOur
employees
and
independent
contractors
may
engage
in
misconduct
or
other
improper
activities,
which
could
have
an
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial\ncondition
and
operating
results.\nWe
are
exposed
to
the
risk
that
our
employees
and
independent
contractors
may
engage
in
misconduct
or
other
illegal
activity.
Misconduct
by
these
parties
could
include\nintentional,
reckless
or
negligent
conduct
or
other
activities
that
violate
laws
and
regulations,
including
production
standards,
U.S.
federal
and
state
fraud,
abuse,
data
privacy
and\nsecurity
laws,
other
similar
non-U.S.
laws
or
laws
that
require
the
true,
complete
and
accurate
reporting
of
financial
information
or
data.
It
is
not
always
possible
to
identify
and\ndeter
misconduct
by
employees
and
other
third
parties,
and
the
precautions
we
take
to
detect
and
prevent
this
activity
may
not
be
effective
in
controlling
unknown
or
unmanaged\nrisks
or
losses
or
in
protecting
us
from
governmental
investigations
or
other
actions
or
lawsuits
stemming
from
a
failure
to
be
in
compliance
with
such
laws
or
regulations.
In\naddition,
we
are
subject
to
the
risk
that
a
person
or
government
could
allege
such
fraud
or
other
misconduct,
even
if
none
occurred.
If
any
such
actions
are
instituted
against
us,
and\nwe
are
not
successful
in
defending
ourselves
or
asserting
our
rights,
those
actions
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating\nresults,
including,
without
limitation,
the
imposition
of
significant
civil,
criminal
and
administrative
penalties,
damages,
monetary
fines,
disgorgement,
integrity
oversight
and\nreporting
obligations
to
resolve
allegations
of
non-compliance,
imprisonment,
other
sanctions,
contractual
damages,
reputational
harm,
diminished
profits
and
future
earnings
and\ncurtailment
of
our
operations,
any
of
which
could
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nWe
expect
initial
launch
of
our
EVs
to
be
concentrated
in
certain
targeted
jurisdictions,
putting
it
at
risk
of
region-specific
disruptions.\nWe
expect
to
initially
launch
our
EV
offerings
in
limited
jurisdictions.
Accordingly,
our
business
and
results
of
operations
are
particularly
susceptible
to
adverse
economic,\nregulatory,
political,
weather
and
other
conditions
in
other
markets
that
may
become
similarly
concentrated.

any
adverse
changes
or
events
in
our
targeted
jurisdictions
may
expose
our
business
and
results
of
operations
to
more
significant
risks.\nWe
may
become
subject
to
product
liability
claims,
including
possible
class
action
and
derivative
lawsuits,
which
could
harm
our
financial
condition
and
liquidity
if
we
are
not\nable
to
successfully
defend
or
insure
against
such
claims.\nProduct
liability
claims,
even
those
without
merit
or
those
that
do
not
involve
our
EVs,
could
harm
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
The\nautomobile
industry
in
particular
experiences
significant
product
liability
claims,
and
we
face
inherent
risk
of
exposure
to
claims
in
the
event
our
EVs
do
not
perform
or
are
claimed\nto
not
have
performed
as
expected.
As
is
true
for
other
EV
suppliers,
we
expect
in
the
future
that
our
EVs
will
be
involved
in
crashes
resulting
in
death
or
personal
injury.\nAdditionally,
product
liability
claims
that
affect
our
competitors
or
suppliers
may
cause
indirect
adverse
publicity
for
us
and
our
EVs.\nA
successful
product
liability
claim
against
us
could
require
us
to
pay
a
substantial
monetary
award.
Our
risks
in
this
area
are
particularly
pronounced
given
we
have
not\ndeployed
our
EVs
for
consumer
use
to
date
and
the
limited
field
experience
of
our
EVs.
Moreover,
a
product
liability
claim
against
us
or
our
competitors
could
generate
substantial\nnegative
publicity
about
our
EVs
and
business
and
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
brand,
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
We
may
self-\ninsure
against
the
risk
of
product
liability
claims
for
vehicle
exposure,
meaning
that
any
product
liability
claims
will
likely
have
to
be
paid
from
company
funds,
not
by
insurance.\nOur
business
may
be
adversely
affected
by
labor
and
union
activities.\nAlthough
none
of
our
employees
are
currently
represented
by
a
labor
union,
it
is
common
throughout
the
automobile
industry
generally
for
many
employees
at
automobile\ncompanies
to
belong
to
a
union,
which
can
result
in
higher
employee
costs
and
increased
risk
of
work
stoppages.
We
may
also
directly
and
indirectly
depend
upon
other
companies\nwith
unionized
work
forces,
such
as
our
manufacturing
partners,
parts
suppliers
and
trucking
and
freight
companies,
and
work
stoppages
or
strikes
organized
by
such
unions
could\nhave
a
material
adverse
impact
on
our
business,
financial
condition
or
operating
results.\nWe
no
longer
qualify
as
an
“emerging
growth
company”
within
the
meaning
of
the
Securities
Act
and
in
the
future
will
be
required
to
comply
with
the
auditor
attestation\nrequirements
of
Section
404
of
the
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.\nWe
previously
qualified
as
an
“emerging
growth
company”
as
defined
in
Section
2(a)
of
the
Securities
Act,
as
amended,
and
elected

take
advantage
of
the
benefits
of
the\nextended

period
for
new
or
revised
financial
accounting
standards
and
certain
other
exemptions
and
reduced
reporting
requirements
provided
by
the
JOBS

we
have
previously
not
been
required
to
provide
an
auditor’s
attestation
report
on
our
system
of
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
pursuant
to
Section
404(b)
of\nthe
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

value
of

non-voting

equity
held
by
non-affiliates
as
of
June
30,

we

10-K
for
the

ending
December
31,
2021.
As
a
result,\nour
independent

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS\nThe
following
discussion
and

provides
information
that
our
management
believes
is
relevant
to
an
assessment
and
understanding
of
our
results
of
operations
and\nfinancial
condition.
This
discussion
and
analysis
should
be
read
in
conjunction
with
our
consolidated
financial
statements
and
the
related
notes
contained
elsewhere
in
this
Annual\nReport
on

development
of
our
own
manufacturing
facilities,
industry
trends,
our\nexpectations
regarding
our

is
a
high
tech
advanced
mobility
technology
company
with
a
mission
to
bring
electric
vehicles
(“EVs”)
to
everyone
and
provide
connected
services
that
improve\nthe
fleet
or
individual
vehicle
ownership
experience.
We
are
developing
a
technology
platform
that
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
rapidly
innovate,
iterate
and
bring
new
products,\naddressing
multiple
use
cases,
to
market
faster
than
our
competition
and
at
lower
cost.
Our
vehicle
architecture
and
design
philosophy
are
aimed
at
driving
productivity
and\nreturning
capital
to
our
customers,
and
we
believe
the
software
and
technology
capabilities
we
are
developing,
packaged
around
a
modular,
customizable
product,
have
the
potential\nto
empower
the
customer
experience
across
a
vehicle’s
lifecycle.
We
remain
committed
to
the
environment
and
to
delivering
sustainable
mobility
that
is
accessible
to
everyone.
We\nproudly
intend
to
manufacture
our
fully
electric
vehicles
in
Oklahoma,
bringing
advanced
manufacturing
and
technology
jobs
to
communities
in
America's
heartland.
We
are\ncommitted
to
building
a
diverse
workforce
that
will
draw
heavily
upon
the
local
communities
of
Native
Americans
and
veterans.\nWe
believe
we
are
one
of
the
first
automotive
manufacturers
focused
on
monetizing
value
across
the
entirety
of
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.
Our
platform\nand
data
architecture
is
purpose-built
to
be
durable
and
serve
as
the
foundation
for
the
vehicles
we
intend
to
offer,
unlocking
a
highly
differentiated,
multi-layer
business
model.
The\nfoundational
layer
is
our
Multi-Purpose
Platform
(“MPP”
or
“platform”)
architecture,
which
serves
as
the
base
of
our
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
its
Delivery,\nBase,
Premium,
and
Adventure
trims;
the
Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicle
(“MPDV”)
and
the
Pickup.
The
next
layer
is
cybersecurity
which
is
embedded
in
our
vehicle
to
ensure\nthe
privacy
and
protection
of
vehicle
data.
Our
top
hats,
or
cabins,
are
modular
and
purpose-built
to
provide
tailored
solutions
for
our
customers.
This
intentional
design
enables
us\nto
efficiently
use
resources
to
produce
only
what
is
necessary,
underscoring
our
focus
on
sustainability
and
returning
capital
to
customers.
The
remaining
layers,
connected\naccessories
and
digital
customer
ecosystem,
present
high-margin
opportunities
that
extend
beyond
the
initial
vehicle
sale,\n(1)\n59\n"",

Owners
will
further
be
able
to
customize
their
vehicles
by
adding
connected
accessories
such
as
Bluetooth
devices
or
infotainment
systems.
In
addition,\nthere
are
opportunities
for
software
sales
throughout
the
vehicle
life,
including
predictive
maintenance
and
service
software
or
advanced
driver
assistance
systems
(“ADAS”)\nupgrades.\nOur
platform
architecture
is
a
self-contained,
fully
functional
rolling
chassis
that
directly
houses
the
most
critical
components
for
operation
of
an
EV,
including
our
in-\nhouse
designed
proprietary
electric
drivetrain,
battery
systems,
advanced
vehicle
control
electronics
and
software
and
other
critical
components,
which
all
have
been
optimized
for\nfunctional
integration.
Both
our
true
steer-by-wire
system,
believed
to
be
the
first
such
system
applied
to
a
production-intent
vehicle,
and
our
transverse
composite
leaf-spring\nsuspension
system
are
core
components
of
our
platform’s
differentiated
functionality,
enabling
the
development
of
a
broad
range
of
vehicle
types
and
use
cases
due
to
the
chassis’\nflat
profile
and
fully
variable
steering
positions.
All
of
our
announced
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle,
the
MPDV
and
the
Pickup,
will\nshare
a
common
platform
architecture
paired
with
different
top
hats
to
create
a
range
of
uniquely
customized
and
use
case
optimized
purpose-built
mobility
solutions
targeting\nmultiple
segments
of
the
rapidly
expanding
EV
marketplace.\nIn
addition
to
our
vehicle
technology,
we
are
developing
an
in-house
designed
and
proprietary
software
platform
that
aggregates
car
data
from
both
Canoo
and
non-Canoo\nvehicles
and
delivers
valuable
insights
to
our
customers.
Collected
over-the-air
for
connected
vehicles
or
via
an
on-board
diagnostics
(“OBD”)
device
for
non-connected
vehicles,\nwe
believe
car
data
is
critical
to
powering
the
customer
journey
and
maximizing
utility
and
value
from
the
vehicle
ownership
experience.
Leveraging
our
data
aggregation
platform,\nwe
aim
to
create
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
an
application
store
that
centralizes
all
vehicle
information
for
customers
and
provides
key
tools
across
Security
&
Safety,\nHousehold
Vehicle
Management,
Fleet
Management,
Lifecycle
Management
and
Vehicle
Asset
Management.
Through
our
software
offering,
we
believe
we
can
provide\ndifferentiated
and
substantial
value
to
both
commercial
customers
and
consumers
and
stay
connected
throughout
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.\nCore
to
our
values
is
delivering
high
quality
products
while
empowering
local
communities,
which
drove
our
decision
to
build
in
America
and
source
a
majority
of
our\nparts
from
America
and
allied
nations.
We
believe
vertical
integration
across
our
manufacturing
and
assembly
process
will
enable
us
to
achieve
in-house
scale
production
with
less\nsupply
chain
risk
and
provide
us
better
oversight
of
our
vehicle
manufacturing.
We
are
building
production
facilities
in
states
and
communities
that
are
investing
in
high-tech\nmanufacturing
alongside
us,
creating
American
jobs
and
driving
innovation.\nWe
have
made
strategic
investments
in
our
technology
and
products
that
position
us
to
capture
three
large
and
growing
markets
-
commercial
and
passenger
vehicles,\nupfitting
and
accessories,
and
telematics
data.\nSince
our
founding
in
2017,
we
continue
to
innovate
on
our
technology
and
strategy.
In
2022,
we
have
achieved
critical
milestones
in
the
development,
testing,
and\nmanufacturing
of
our
platform
and
product,
as
well
as
important
developments
for
our
business:\n•\nSelected
by
NASA
to
provide
crew
transport
for
Artemis
lunar
exploration
launch\n•\nReceived
Walmart
order
to
purchase
up
to
10,000

We
continue
to
innovate
and
develop
every
aspect
of
our
business,
from
our
non-traditional
business
model
to
our
built
in
America,
highly
utilitarian
vehicles
optimized
to
return\ncapital
to
our
customers.
We
believe
being
forward-thinking
across
these
areas
has
set
the
foundation
for
us
to
develop
into
a
scalable
business
that
is
differentiated
from

success
depend
on
several
factors
that
present
significant
opportunities
for
us
but
also
pose
risks
and
challenges,
including\nthose
discussed
below
and
in
Item
1A,
“Risk
Factors.”\nAvailability
of
Financing
Sources
and
Commercialization
of
Our
EVs\nWe
expect
to
derive
future
revenue
from
our
first
vehicle
offerings.
In
order
to
reach
commercialization,
we
must
purchase
and
integrate
related
property
and
equipment,\nas
well
as
achieve
several
research
and
development
milestones.\nOur
capital
and
operating
expenditures
have
increased
significantly
in
connection
with
our
ongoing
activities
and
we
expect
they
will
continue
to
increase,
as
we:\n•\ncontinue
to
invest
in
our
technology,
research
and
development
efforts;\n•\ncompensate
existing
personnel;\n•\ninvest
in
manufacturing
capacity,
via
our
owned
facilities;\n•\nincrease
our
investment
in
marketing,
advertising,
sales
and
distribution
infrastructure
for
our
EVs
and
services;\n•\nobtain,
maintain
and
improve
our
operational,
financial
and
management
information
systems;\n•\nhire
additional
personnel;\n•\ncommercialize
our
EVs;\n•\nobtain,
maintain,
expand
and
protect
our
intellectual
property
portfolio;
and\n•\ncontinue
to
operate
as
a
public
company.\nWe
require
substantial
additional
capital
to
develop
our
EVs
and
services
and
fund
our
operations
for
the
foreseeable
future.
We
will
also
require
capital
to
identify
and\ncommit
resources
to
investigate
new
areas
of
demand.
Until
we
can
generate
sufficient
revenue
from
vehicle
sales,
we
are
financing
our
operations
through
access
to
private
and\npublic
equity
offerings
and
debt
financings.
Management
believes
substantial
doubt
exists
about
the
Company’s
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
for
twelve
months
from
the\ndate
of
issuance
of
the
financial
statements
included
in
this
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K.\nMacroeconomic
Conditions\nCurrent
adverse
macroeconomic
conditions,
including
but
not
limited
to
heightened
inflation,
slower
growth
or
recession,
changes
to
fiscal
and
monetary
policy,
higher\ninterest
rates,
currency
fluctuations,
and
challenges
in
the
supply
chain
could
negatively
affect
our
business.\nIncreased
demand
for
semiconductor
chips
in
2020,
due
in
part
to
the
increased
demand
for
consumer
electronics
that
use
these
chips,
resulted
in
a
global
shortage
of
chips\nin
2021
that
has
continued
into
2023.
As
a
result,
our
ability
to
source
semiconductor
chips
used
in
our
vehicles
may
be
adversely
affected.
This
shortage
may
result
in
increased\nchip
delivery
lead
times,
delays
in
the
production
of
our
vehicles,
and
increased
costs
to
source
available
semiconductor
chips.\nAlthough
we
have
made
our
best
estimates
based
upon
current
information,
actual
results
could
materially
differ
from
the
estimates
and
assumptions
developed
by\nmanagement.
Accordingly,
it
is
reasonably
possible
that
the
estimates
made
in
the
financial
statements
have
been,
or
will
be,
materially
and
adversely
impacted
in
the
near
term
as
a\nresult
of
these
conditions,
and
if
so,
we
may
be
subject
to
future
impairment
losses
related
to
long-lived
assets
as
well
as
changes
to
valuations.\n61\n',

of

liability
of
$1.6
million
for
the
year
ended
December

which
was
a
result
of
the\nperiodic
remeasurement
of
the

value
of
our
private
placement
warrants
liability.
All
of
the
private
placement
warrants
were
converted
to
public
warrants
on
March
2,
2021.\nLoss
on
Extinguishment
of
Debt\nWe
recognized
$4.6
million
of
extinguishment
of
debt
loss
as
a
result
of
repayments
made
to
Yorkville
of
convertible
debt
through
the
issuance
of
shares
during
the
year\nended
December
31,
2022.\nNon-GAAP
Financial
Measures\nIn
addition
to
our
results
determined
in
accordance
with
accounting
principles
generally
accepted
in
the
United
States
(""GAAP""),
we
believe
the
following
non-GAAP\nmeasures
are
useful
in
evaluating
our
operational
performance.
We
use
the
following
non-GAAP
measures
to
evaluate
our
ongoing
operations
and
for
internal
planning
and\nforecasting
purposes.
We
believe
that
non-GAAP
financial
information,
when
taken
collectively,
may
be
helpful
to
investors
in
assessing
our
operating
performance.\nEBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA\n“EBITDA”
is
defined
as
net
loss
before
interest
expense,
income
tax
expense
or
benefit,
and
depreciation
and
amortization.
“Adjusted
EBITDA”
is
defined
as
EBITDA\nadjusted
for
stock-based
compensation,
restructuring
charges,
asset
impairments,
and
other
costs
associated
with
exit
and
disposal
activities,
acquisition
and
related
costs,
changes
to\nthe
fair
value
of
contingent
earnout
shares
liability,
changes
to
the
fair
value
of
warrants
liability,
and
any
other
one-time
non-recurring
transaction
amounts
impacting
the
statement\nof
operations
during
the
year.
Adjusted
EBITDA
is
intended
as
a
supplemental
measure
of
our
performance
that
is
neither
required
by,
nor
presented
in
accordance
with,
GAAP.\nWe
believe
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA,
when
combined
with
net
loss
are
beneficial
to
an
investor’s
complete
understanding
of
our
operating
performance.
We
believe
that
the\nuse
of
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
provides
an
additional
tool
for
investors
to
use
in
evaluating
ongoing
operating
results
and
trends
and
in
comparing
our
financial
measures\nwith
those
of
comparable
companies,
which
may
present
similar
non-GAAP
financial
measures
to
investors.
However,
you
should
be
aware
that
when
evaluating
EBITDA
and\nAdjusted
EBITDA
we
may
incur
future
expenses
similar
to
those
excluded
when
calculating
these
measures.
In
addition,
our
presentation
of
these
measures
should
not
be\nconstrued
as
an
inference
that
our
future
results
will
be
unaffected
by
unusual
or
non-recurring
items.
Our
computation
of
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
may
not
be
comparable\nto
other
similarly
titled
measures
computed
by
other
companies,
because
all
companies
may
not
calculate
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
in
the
same
fashion.\nBecause
of
these
limitations,
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
should
not
be
considered
in
isolation
or
as
a
substitute
for
performance
measures
calculated
in
accordance\nwith
GAAP.
We
manage
our
business
utilizing
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
as
supplemental
performance
measures.\n65\n',

we
had
unrestricted
cash
and

equivalents
in
the
amount
of
$36.6
million,
which
was
primarily
invested
in
money
market
funds
that
consist\nof
liquid
debt
securities
issued
by
the
U.S.
government.
In
assessing
our
liquidity
requirements
and
cash
needs,
we
also
consider
contractual
obligations
to
which
we
are
a
party.\nAdditionally,
see
discussion
related
to
the
operating
lease
maturity
schedule
and
any
new
leases
entered
into
in
Note
10
of
the
notes
to
our
accompanying
financial
statements.\nWe
have
incurred
and
expect
to
incur,
net
losses
which
have
resulted
in
an
accumulated
deficit
of
$1.2
billion
as
of
December
31,
2022.
Management
continues
to
explore\nraising
additional
capital
through
a
combination
of
debt
financing,
other
non-dilutive
financing
and/or
equity
financing
to
supplement
the
Company’s
capitalization
and
liquidity.
If\nand
as
we
raise
additional
funds
by
incurring
loans
or
by
issuing
debt
securities
or
preferred
stock,
these
forms
of
financing
have
rights,
preferences,
and
privileges
senior
to
those\nof
holders
of
our
Common
Stock.
The
availability
and
the
terms
under
which
we
are
able
to
raise
additional
capital
could
be
disadvantageous,
and
the
terms
of
debt
financing
or\nother
non-dilutive
financing
involve
restrictive
covenants
and
dilutive
financing
instruments,
which
could
place
significant
restrictions
on
our
operations.
Macroeconomic\nconditions
and
credit
markets
are
also
impacting
the
availability
and
cost
of
potential
future
debt
financing.
As
we
raise
capital
through
the
issuance
of
additional
equity,
such
sales\nand
issuance
has
and
will
continue
to
dilute
the
ownership
interests
of
the
existing
holders
of
Common
Stock.
There
can
be
no
assurances
that
any
additional
debt,
other
non-\ndilutive
and/or
equity
financing
would
be
available
to
us
on
favorable
terms
or
at
all.
We
expect
to
continue
to
incur
net
losses,
comprehensive
losses,
and
negative
cash
flows
from\noperating
activities
in

with
our
operating
plan
as
we
continue

the
development
of
our
MPP
and
EVs,\nestablish
our
go-to-market
model
and
scale
our

to
meet
anticipated
demand.
We
expect
that
both
our
capital
and
operating
expenditures
will
increase
significantly
in\nconnection

Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates\nOur
consolidated
financial
statements
are
prepared
in
accordance
with

The
preparation
of
these

requires
us
to
make
estimates
and
assumptions\nthat
affect
the
reported
amounts
of
assets
and
liabilities
and
the
disclosure
of
contingent
assets
and

as
of
the
date
of
the
financial
statements,
as
well
as
the
reported\nexpenses
incurred
during
the
reporting
periods.
Our
estimates
are
based
on
our
historical
experience
and
on
various
other
factors
that
we
believe
are
reasonable
under
the\ncircumstances,
the
results
of
which
form
the
basis

judgments
about

results
may
differ
from
these

under
different
assumptions
or
conditions.
We
believe
that
the
accounting
policies
discussed
below
are
critical
to\nunderstanding
our
historical
and

performance,
as
these
policies
relate
to
the

Liability\nThe
Company
has
a
contingent
obligation
to
issue
shares
of
Common
Stock
to
certain
stockholders
and
employees
upon
the
achievement
of
certain
market
share
price\nmilestones
within
specified
periods
(the
“Earnout
Shares”).
The
initial
fair
value
of
our
contingent
Earnout
Shares
liability
was
recognized
at
$248.9
million
with
a
corresponding\nreduction
from
the
additional
paid
in
capital
in
our
stockholders’
equity.
The
terms
and
conditions
of
the
right
to
receive
Earnout
Shares
are
described
in
Note
4
to
the\naccompanying
consolidated
financial
statements.
In
accordance
with
the
guidance
under
Accounting
Standards
Codification
(""ASC"")
815,
Derivatives
and
Hedging,
the
Earnout\nShares
right
are
classified
as
a
Level
3
fair
value
measurement
liability,
and
the
increase
or
decrease
in
the
fair
value
during
the
reporting
period
is
recognized
as
other
expense
or\nother
income
in
our
consolidated
statement
of
operations
accordingly.
The
fair
value
of
the
contingent
Earnout
Shares
liability
was
estimated
using
a
Monte
Carlo
simulation
of\nstock
prices
using
an
expected
volatility
assumption
based
on
the
historical
volatility
of
the
price
of
the
Company’s
Common
Stock
and
implied
volatility
derived
from
the
price
of\nexchange
traded
options
on
the
Company’s
Common
Stock.
Changes
in
these
inputs
or
other
underlying
assumptions
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
fair
value
of
the\ncontingent
Earnout
Shares
liability.
Changes
to
contingent
earnout
shares
liability
can
result
from
changes
to
discount
rates
or
accretion
of
the
liability
due
to
the
passage
of
time.\nThe
determination
of
the
contingent
Earnout
Shares
liability
requires
significant
judgments
including
the
appropriateness
of
the
valuation
model,
reasonableness
of
estimates
and\nassumptions,
and
the
discount
rates
applied
to
such
forecasts.\n68\n',

authoritative\nguidance
in

as

This

which
requires
the
use
of
professional
judgment,
is
conducted
at
the
time
of
warrant
issuance\nand
as
of
each

The

concluded
that
the

issued
to
Walmart
and
vested
as

qualify
for

treatment.
The

using
a
Black-Scholes-Merton
model,
with
no\nfair

The
Company
concluded
that
the

Note
16
for
information
regarding
the
warrants
issued

Walmart
and

Compensation\nWe
account
for
stock-based
compensation
awards
granted
to
employees
and
members
of
our
Board
based
on
the
awards’
estimated
grant
date
fair
value
using
a
fair
value\nmethod.
For
awards
that
vest
solely
based
on
continued
service
(“requisite
service”),
the
resulting
fair
value
is
recognized
as
an
expense
on
an
accelerated
basis
over
the
requisite\nservice
period,
which
is
generally
four
years.
For
awards
which
contain
performance
conditions,
the
resulting
fair
value
is
recognized
over
the
requisite
service
period
using
the\ngraded
vesting
method,
when
it
is
probable
the
performance
conditions
will
be
met.
We
account
for
forfeitures
as
they
occur.\nWe
estimate
the
fair
value
of
RSUs
based
on
the
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock
underlying
the
awards
on
the
grant
date.
Fair
value
for
awards
with
our
stock
price\nperformance
metrics
is
calculated
using
the
Monte
Carlo
simulation
model,
which
incorporates
stock
price
correlation
and
other
variables
over
the
time
horizons
matching
the\nperformance
periods.\nThe
assumptions
underlying
these
valuations
represent
management’s
best
estimates,
which
involve
inherent
uncertainties
and
the
application
of
management
judgment.\nAs
a
result,
if
factors
or
expected
outcomes
change
and
our
management
uses
significantly
different
assumptions
or
estimates,
our
stock-based
compensation
expense
for
future\nperiods
could
be
materially
different,
including
as
a
result
of
adjustments
to
stock-based
compensation
expense
recorded
for
prior
periods.\nFor
the
years
ended
December
31,
2022
and
2021
total
stock-based
compensation
expense
was
$79.6
million
and
$108.4
million,
respectively.\nSmaller

value
of

Common
Stock
held
by
non-affiliates
as

June
30,

pursuant
to

Act
in
this

of

QUANTITATIVE
AND
QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES
ABOUT
MARKET
RISK\nWe
have
not,
to
date,
been
exposed
to
material
market
risks
given
our
early
stage
of
operations.
Upon
[commencing
commercial
operations,
we
may
be
exposed
to\nmaterial
market
risks].
Market
risk
represents
the
risk
of
loss
that
may
impact
our
financial
position
due
to
adverse
changes
in
financial
market
prices
and
rates.
Our
current
market\nrisk\nexposure
is
primarily
the
result
of
fluctuations
in
interest
rates.\nInterest
Rate
Risk\nWe
are
exposed
to
market
risk
for
changes
in
interest
rates
applicable
to
our
cash
and
cash
equivalents.
We
had
cash
and
cash
equivalents
totaling
$36.6
million
as
of\nDecember
31,
2022.
Our
cash
and
cash
equivalents
were
invested
primarily
in
money
market
funds
and
are
not
invested
for
trading
or
speculative
purposes.
However,
due
to
the\nshort-term
nature
and
the
low-risk
profile
of
the
money
market
funds,
we
do
not
believe
a
sudden
increase
or
decrease
in
market
interest
rates
would
have
a
material
effect
on
the\nfair
market
value
of
our
portfolio.\nInflation
Risk\nWe
do
not
believe
that
inflation
has
had
a
material
effect
on
our
business,
financial
condition
or
results
of
operations.
Inflationary
factors
such
as
increases
in
material\ncosts
(e.g.
semiconductor
chips)
or
overhead
costs
may
adversely
affect
our
business,
financial
condition,
and
operating
costs
upon
commencing
commercial
operations.\n70\n',

of
Independent
Registered
Public
Accounting
Firm\nTo
the
shareholders
and
the
Board
of
Directors
of
Canoo
Inc.\nOpinion
on
the
Financial
Statements\nWe
have
audited
the
accompanying
consolidated
balance
sheets
of
Canoo
Inc.
and
subsidiaries
(the
""Company"")
as
of
December
31,
2022
and

the
related
consolidated\nstatements
of
operations,
stockholders’
equity,
and
cash
flows,
for
each
of
the
two
years
in
the
period
ended
December
31,
2022,
and
the
related
notes
(collectively
referred
to
as
the\n""financial
statements"").
In
our
opinion,
the
financial
statements
present
fairly,
in
all
material
respects,
the
financial
position
of
the
Company
as
of
December
31,
2022
and
2021,
and\nthe
results
of
its
operations
and
its
cash
flows
for
each
of
the
two
years
in
the
period
ended
December
31,
2022,
in
conformity
with
accounting
principles
generally
accepted
in
the\nUnited
States
of
America
(“US
GAAP”).\nGoing
Concern\nThe
accompanying
financial
statements
have
been
prepared
assuming
that
the
Company
will
continue
as
a
going
concern.
As
discussed
in
Note
2
to
the
financial
statements,
the\nCompany
has
suffered
recurring
losses
from
operations,
has
generated
recurring
negative
cash
flows
from
operating
activities,
and
expects
to
continue
to
incur
net
losses
and\nnegative
cash
flows
from
operating
activities
in
accordance
with
its
ongoing
activities.
These
matters
raise
substantial
doubt
about
the
Company’s
ability
to
continue
as
a
going\nconcern.
Management\'s
plans
in
regard
to
these
matters
are
also
described
in
Note
2.
The
financial
statements
do
not
include
any
adjustments
that
might
result
from
the
outcome
of\nthis
uncertainty.\nBasis
for
Opinion\nThese
financial
statements
are
the
responsibility
of
the
Company\'s
management.
Our
responsibility
is
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
Company\'s
financial
statements
based
on
our\naudits.
We
are
a
public
accounting
firm
registered
with
the
Public
Company
Accounting
Oversight
Board
(United
States)
(PCAOB)
and
are
required
to
be
independent
with
respect\nto
the
Company
in
accordance
with
the
U.S.
federal
securities
laws
and
the
applicable
rules
and
regulations
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
and
the
PCAOB.\nWe
conducted
our
audits
in
accordance
with
the
standards
of
the
PCAOB.
Those
standards
require
that
we
plan
and
perform
the
audit
to
obtain
reasonable
assurance
about
whether\nthe
financial
statements
are
free
of
material
misstatement,
whether
due
to
error
or
fraud.
The
Company
is
not
required
to
have,
nor
were
we
engaged
to
perform,
an
audit
of
its\ninternal
control
over
financial
reporting.
As
part
of
our
audits,
we
are
required
to
obtain
an
understanding
of
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
but
not
for
the
purpose
of\nexpressing
an
opinion
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
Company’s
internal
control
over
financial
reporting.
Accordingly,
we
express
no
such
opinion.\nOur
audits
included
performing
procedures
to
assess
the
risks
of
material
misstatement
of
the
financial
statements,
whether
due
to
error
or
fraud,
and
performing
procedures
that\nrespond
to
those
risks.
Such
procedures
included
examining,
on
a
test
basis,
evidence
regarding
the
amounts
and
disclosures
in
the
financial
statements.
Our
audits
also
included\nevaluating
the
accounting
principles
used
and
significant
estimates
made
by
management,
as
well
as
evaluating
the
overall
presentation
of
the
financial
statements.
We
believe
that\nour
audits
provide
a
reasonable
basis
for
our
opinion.\nCritical
Audit
Matter\nThe
critical
audit
matter
communicated
below
is
a
matter
arising
from
the
current-period
audit
of
the
financial
statements
that
was
communicated
or
required
to
be
communicated
to\nthe

committee
and
that

or
disclosures
that
are
material
to
the
financial
statements
and
(2)
involved
our
especially
challenging,
subjective,
or
complex\njudgments.
The
communication
of
critical
audit
matters
does
not
alter
in
any
way
our
opinion
on
the
financial
statements,
taken
as
a

the
Company
and
Walmart,
and
c)
any
net
revenue
attributable
to
any
products
or
services
offered
by
Walmart
or
its
affiliates
related
to
the
Company,
until
such
net\nrevenue
equals
$300.0
million,
at
which
time
the
Warrant
will
have
vested
fully.\nAs
Walmart
is
a
customer
of
the
Company,
the
issuance
of
the
Warrant
represented
consideration
payable
to
a
customer
under
US
GAAP.
Accordingly,
the
Warrant
was
measured\nat
fair
value
upon
issuance,
and
the
portion
of
the
Warrant
that
vested
immediately
was
recorded
as
an
asset,
which
will
subsequently
be
amortized
on
a
pro-rata
basis,
commencing\nupon
initial
performance,
over
the
term
of
the
EV
Agreement.\nThe
fair
value
of
the
Warrant
was
measured
using
the
Black-Scholes-Merton
option
pricing
model.
Management
judgment
was
required
in
determining
the
appropriateness
of
the\nuse
of
the
Black-Scholes
Merton
option
pricing
model.
Certain
inputs
used
in
applying
the
Black-Scholes
Merton
option
pricing
model
require
assumptions,
which
also
require\nmanagement
judgment.\nWe
identified
management’s
accounting
for
the
Warrant
in
accordance
with
US
GAAP
and
determination
of
the
Warrant’s
fair
value
as
a
critical
audit
matter
due
to
the
significant\njudgment
involved.
Auditing
management’s
judgments
and
assumptions
was
especially
challenging
and
required
a
high
degree
of
auditor
judgment
and
an
increased
extent
of
effort,\nincluding
the
involvement
of
professionals
in
our
firm
having
expertise
in
accounting
and
our
fair
value
specialists.\nHow
the
Critical
Audit
Matter
Was
Addressed
in
the
Audit\nOur
audit
procedures
related
to
testing
management’s
application
of
US
GAAP
to
the
Warrant
and
determination
of
the
Warrant’s
fair
value
included
the
following,
among
others:\n•\nWe
obtained
and
read
the
EV
Agreement,
the
Warrant
Agreement,
and
management's
analysis
of
the
application
of
US
GAAP
to
the
Warrant.\n•\nWith
the
assistance
of
professionals
in
our
firm
having
expertise
in
accounting
for
consideration
payable
to
a
customer
and
share-based
payment
transactions,
we
evaluated\nmanagement’s
conclusions
regarding
the
initial
accounting
for
the
portion
of
the
Warrant
that
vested
immediately
under
US
GAAP.\n•\nWith
the
assistance
of
our
fair
value
specialists,
we:\n•\nEvaluated
the
appropriateness
of
management’s
application
of
the
Black-Scholes-Merton
option
pricing
model.\n•\nEvaluated
the
reasonableness
of
management's
key
valuation
assumptions,
including
the
share
price
used
by
considering
the
potential
impact
of
material
non-public\ninformation,
and
the
volatility
rate
used
by
developing
a
range
of
independent
estimates
and
comparing
those
estimates
to
the
volatility
rate
selected
by\nmanagement.\n/s/

Organization
and
Description
of
the
Business\nDescription
of
the
Business\nCanoo
Inc.
(“Canoo”
or
the
“Company”)
is
a
high-tech
advanced
mobility
technology
company
with
a
mission
to
bring
electric
vehicles
(""EVs"")
to
everyone.
We
have\ndeveloped
a
breakthrough
EV
platform
that
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
rapidly
innovate,
and
bring
new
products
addressing
multiple
use
cases
to
market
faster
than
our\ncompetition
and
at
a
lower
cost.\n2.
Basis
of
Presentation
and
Summary
of
Significant
Accounting
Policies\nBasis
of
Presentation
and
Principles
of
Consolidation\nThe
Company’s
consolidated
financial
statements
have
been
prepared
in
accordance
with
accounting
principles
generally
accepted
in
the
United
States
of
America\n(""GAAP"")
on
a
going
concern
basis,
which
contemplates
the
realization
of
assets
and
the
discharge
of
liabilities
in
the
normal
course
of
business
for
the
foreseeable
future.\nThe
consolidated
financial
statements
include
the
results
of
Canoo
Inc.
and
its
subsidiaries.
Our
comprehensive
loss
is
the
same
as
our
net
loss.
All
intercompany\ntransactions
and
balances
have
been
eliminated
in
the
consolidation.\nCertain
amounts
in
the
prior
period
financial
statements
have
been
reclassified
to
conform
to
the
presentation
of
the
current
period
financial
statements.
Reclassification\nadjustments
had
no
impact
on
prior
year
net
income
(loss)
or
shareholders’
equity.\nLiquidity
and
Capital
Resources\nAs
of
December
31,
2022,
the
Company’s
principal
sources
of
liquidity
are
its
unrestricted
cash
balance
in
the
amount
of
$36.6
million
and
its
access
to
capital
under
the\nATM
Offering
(defined
below
in
Note
14)
and
Yorkville
facilities.
The
Company
has
incurred
losses
since
inception
and
had
negative
cash
flow
from
operating
activities
of\n$400.5
million
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2022.
The
Company
expects
to
continue
to
incur
net
losses
and
negative
cash
flows
from
operating
activities
in
accordance
with
its\noperating
plan
and
expects
that
both
capital
and
operating
expenditures
will
increase
significantly
in
connection
with
its
ongoing
activities.\nAs
an
early-stage
growth
company,
the
Company\'s
ability
to
access
capital
is
critical.
Although
management
continues
to
explore
raising
additional
capital
through
a\ncombination
of
debt
financing,
other
non-dilutive
financing
and/or
equity
financing
to
supplement
the
Company’s
capitalization
and
liquidity,
management
cannot
conclude
as
of\nthe
date
of
this
filing
that
its
plans
are
probable
of
being
successfully
implemented.
The
consolidated
financial
information
does
not
include
any
adjustments
that
might
result
from\nthe
outcome
of
this
uncertainty.\nThe
Company
believes
substantial
doubt
exists
about
the
Company’s
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
for
twelve
months
from
the
date
of
issuance
of
our
financial\nstatements.\nMacroeconomic
Conditions\nCurrent
adverse
macroeconomic
conditions,
including
but
not
limited
to
heightened
inflation,
slower
growth
or
recession,
changes
to
fiscal
and
monetary
policy,
higher\ninterest
rates,
currency
fluctuations,
and
challenges
in
the
supply
chain
could
negatively
affect
our
business.\nUltimately,
the
Company
cannot
predict
the
impact
of
current
or
worsening
macroeconomic
conditions.
The
Company
continues
to
monitor
macroeconomic
conditions
to\nremain
flexible
and
to
optimize
and
evolve
its
business
as
appropriate.
To
do
this,
the
Company
is
working
on
projecting
demand
and
infrastructure
requirements
and
deploying
its\nworkforce
and
other
resources
accordingly.\n79\n',

Document(page_content=""Table
of
Contents\nSegment
and
Geographic
Information\nOur
principal
executive
officer,
as
the
chief
operating
decision
maker,
organizes
the
Company,
manages
resource
allocations
and
measures
performance
on
the
basis
of
one\noperating
segment.\nThe
Company’s
property
and
equipment
and
right
of
use
assets
are
located
primarily
in
the
United
States
of
America.\nUse
of
Estimates\nThe
preparation
of
financial
statements
in
conformity
with
GAAP
requires
management
to
make
estimates
and
assumptions
that
affect
the
reported
amounts
of
assets
and\nliabilities
and
disclosure
of
contingent
assets
and
liabilities
at
the
date
of
the
consolidated
financial
statements
and
the
reported
amounts
of
revenue
and
expenses
during
the\nreporting
period.
Actual
results
could
differ
from
those
estimates.
Estimates
are
periodically
reviewed
in
light
of
changes
in
circumstances,
facts
and
experience.
Changes
in\nestimates
are
recorded
in
the
period
in
which
they
become
known.\nSignificant
estimates
and
assumptions
made
in
the
accompanying
financial
statements
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
the
determination
of
the
useful
lives
of
property
and\nequipment,
valuation
of
deferred
income
tax
assets
and
uncertain
tax
positions,
the
valuation
of
equity
securities
and
stock-based
compensation,
the
recognition
and
disclosure
of\ncontingent
liabilities,
the
fair
value
of
financial
instruments,
inventory,
and
the
estimated
incremental
borrowing
rates
used
to
assess
lease
liabilities.
These
estimates
are
based
on\nhistorical
data
and
experience,
as
well
as
various
other
factors
that
management
believes
to
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
the
results
of
which
form
the
basis
for
making\njudgments
about
the
carrying
value
of
assets
and
liabilities
that
are
not
readily
apparent
from
other
sources.
The
Company
may
engage
third
party
valuation
specialists
to
assist
with\nestimates
related
to
the
valuation
of
the
underlying
value
of
its
assets,
liabilities
and
equity.
Such
estimates
often
require
the
selection
of
appropriate
valuation
methodologies
and\nmodels,
and
significant
judgment
in
evaluating
ranges
of
assumptions
and
financial
inputs.\nCash
and
Cash
Equivalents\nCash
and
cash
equivalents
consist
of
investments
that
are
highly
liquid,
readily
convertible
to
cash
and
which
have
an
original
maturity
date
within
three
months
from
the\ndate
of
purchase
as
well
as
savings,
checking
and
other
bank
accounts.\nConcentration
of
Credit
Risk\nFinancial
instruments
that
potentially
subject
the
Company
to
concentration
of
credit
risk
consist
principally
of
cash
and
cash
equivalents.
The
Company,
at
times,\nmaintains
cash
and
cash
equivalent
balances
at
financial
institutions
in
excess
of
amounts
insured
by
United
States
government
agencies
or
payable
by
the
United
States
government\ndirectly.
The
Company
places
its
cash
with
high
credit
quality
financial
institutions.\nRestricted
Cash\nThe
Company
had
restricted
cash
of
$14.0
million
as
of
December
31,
2022.
The
restricted
cash
represents
a
letter
of
credit
under
the
Company's
Bentonville
lease
of\n$9.5
million,
refundable
customer
deposits
of
$1.9
million,
a

the
Company's

of
$1.1

and
certain
other
individually

balances
of
$1.5
million.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Company
had
restricted
cash
of
$2.8
million.
The
restricted

represents
the

under
the\nCompany's
Michigan
lease
of
$1.1
million,
refundable
customer
deposits
of
$0.9
million,
and
$0.8

Depreciation
of
construction-in-progress
begins
only
once
placed
into
service,
over
the
estimated
useful
life
on
a
straight-line
basis.
The
Company
generally
uses
the\nestimated
useful
lives
for
each
asset
category
as
follows:\nAssets
category\nYears\nLeasehold
improvements\nShorter
of
lease
term
or
estimated
useful
life\nTooling\n5
years\nFurniture
and
fixtures\n5
years\nMachinery
and
equipment\n3
years\nComputer
hardware
and
software\n3
years\nVehicles\n3
years\nLeases\nOn
January
1,
2018,
the
Company
early
adopted
ASC
No.
842,
Leases
(“ASC
842”),
on
a
modified
retrospective
basis
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
of
adoption.
The\nCompany
determines
if
an
arrangement
is
a
lease
at
inception
if
the
Company
concludes
that
the
contract
is
in
the
scope
of
ASC
842
and
the
Company
has
the
right
to
control
the\nidentified
asset.
Operating
leases
are
included
in
operating
lease
right-of-use
(“ROU”)
assets,
and
operating
lease
liabilities
are
included
in
accrued
expenses
and
operating
lease\nliabilities
in
the
consolidated
balance
sheet.\nThe
operating
lease
ROU
assets
represent
the
Company’s
right
to
use
an
underlying
asset
for
the
lease
term
and
lease
liabilities
represent
the
Company’s
obligation
to\nmake
lease
payments
arising
from
the
lease.
The
operating
lease
ROU
assets
and
operating
lease
liabilities
are
recognized
at
the
lease
commencement
date
based
on
the
present\nvalue
of
lease
payments
over
the
lease
term.
As
the
Company’s
leases
do
not
provide
an
implicit
rate,
the
Company
estimates
an
incremental
borrowing
rate
based
on
the
estimated\nmarket
rate
of
interest
for
a
collateralized
borrowing
over
a
similar
term
of
the
lease
payments
at
commencement
date.
The
operating
lease
right-of-use
asset
also
includes
any
lease\npayments
made
prior
to
the
lease
commencement
date.
Lease
expense
for
operating
leases
is
recognized
on
a
straight-line
basis
over
the
lease
term.
The
determination
of
the
lease\nterm
includes
options
to
extend
or
terminate
the
lease
when
it
is
reasonably
certain
that
the
Company
will
exercise
that
option.\nThe
Company
has
elected
to
exclude
short-term
leases
(i.e.,
leases
with
expected
terms
of
12
months
or
less)
from
the
recognition
requirements
of
ASC
842,
and
has\nelected
to
account
for
lease
and
certain
non-lease
components
as
a
single
component.\nRefer
to
Note
10
for
additional
information
regarding
the
Company's
operating
leases.\nImpairment
of
Long-Lived
Assets\nThe
Company
assesses
the
carrying
value
of
its
long-lived
assets,
consisting
primarily
of
property
and
equipment
and
lease
ROU
assets,
annually
or
when
there
is\nevidence
that
events
or
changes
in
circumstances
indicate
that
the
carrying
value
of
an
asset
or
group
of
assets
may
not
be
recoverable.
Such
events
or
changes
in
circumstances\nmay
include
a
significant
decrease
in
the
market
price
of
a
long-lived
asset,
a
significant
change
in
the
extent
or
manner
in
which
an
asset
is
used,
a
significant
change
in
legal\nfactors
or
in
the
business
climate,
a
significant
deterioration
in
the
amount
of
revenue
or
cash
flows
expected
to
be
generated
from
a
group
of
assets,
a
current
expectation
that,
more\nlikely
than
not
a
long-lived
asset
will
be
sold
or
otherwise
disposed
of
significantly
before
the
end
of
its
previously
estimated
useful
life,
or
any
other
significant
adverse
change\nthat
would
indicate
that
the
carrying
value
of
an
asset
or
group
of
assets
may
not
be
recoverable.
The
Company
performs
impairment
testing
at
the
asset
group
level
that
represents\nthe
lowest
level
for
which
identifiable
cash
flows
are
largely
independent
of
the
cash
flows
of
other
assets
and
liabilities.
If
events
or
changes
in
circumstances
indicate
that
the\ncarrying
amount
of
an
asset
group
may
not
be
recoverable
and
the
expected
undiscounted
future
cash
flows
attributable
to
the
asset
group
are
less
than
the
carrying
amount
of
the\nasset
group,
an

The
effect
on

assets
and

of
a\nchange
in
tax
rates
is
recognized
in
income
in
the
period
that

Valuation
allowances
are
established
when
necessary
to
reduce
deferred
tax
assets
to
the\namount
expected
to
be
realized.\nThe
Company
recognizes
the
tax
benefit
from
uncertain
tax
positions
only
if
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
tax
positions
will
be
sustained
on
examination
by
the
tax\nauthorities,
based
on
the
technical
merits
of
the
position.
The

is
measured
based
on
the
largest
benefit
that
has
a
greater
than
50%
likelihood
of
being
realized
upon\nultimate
settlement.
The
Company
recognizes
interest
and
penalties
related
to
income
tax
matters
in
income

expense.\nFair
Value
of
Financial
Instruments\nThe
Company
applies
the
provisions
of
ASC
820,
Fair
Value
Measurements
and
Disclosures,
which
provides
a
single
authoritative
definition
of
fair
value,
sets
out
a\nframework
for
measuring
fair
value
and
expands
on
required
disclosures
about
fair
value
measurement.
Fair
value
represents
the
exchange
price
that
would
be
received
for
an
asset\nor
paid
to
transfer
a
liability
in
the
principal
or
most
advantageous
market
for
the
asset
or
liability
in
an
orderly
transaction
between
market
participants
on
the
measurement
date.\nThe
Company
uses
the
following
hierarchy
in
measuring
the
fair
value
of
the
Company’s
assets
and
liabilities,
focusing
on
the
most
observable
inputs
when
available:\n•\nLevel
1
-
Quoted
prices
in
active
markets
for
identical
assets
or
liabilities.\n•\nLevel
2
-
Observable
inputs
other
than
Level
1
quoted
prices,
such
as
quoted
prices
for
similar
assets
and
liabilities
in
active
markets,
quoted
prices
in
markets
that
are\nnot
active
for
identical
or
similar
assets
and
liabilities,
or
other
inputs
that
are
observable
or
can
be
corroborated
by
observable
market
data
for
substantially
the
full
term\nof
the
assets
or
liabilities.\n•\nLevel
3
-
Valuations
are
based
on
inputs
that
are
unobservable
and
significant
to
the
overall
fair
value
measurement
of
the
assets
or
liabilities.
Inputs
reflect\nmanagement’s
best
estimate
of
what
market
participants
would
use
in
pricing
the
asset
or
liability
at
the
measurement
date.
Consideration
is
given
to
the
risk
inherent
in\nthe
valuation
technique
and
the
risk
inherent
in
the
inputs
to
the
model.\nTo
the
extent
that
the
valuation
is
based
on
models
or
inputs
that
are
less
observable
or
unobservable
in
the
market,
the
determination
of
fair
value
requires
more
judgment.\nAccordingly,
the
degree
of
judgment
exercised
by
the
Company
in
determining
fair
value
is
greatest
for
instruments
categorized
in
Level
3.
A
financial
instrument’s
level
within
the\nfair
value
hierarchy
is
based
on
the
lowest
level
of
any
input
that
is
significant
to
the
fair
value
measurement.\nThe
Company’s
financial
assets
and
liabilities
not
measured
at
fair
value
on
a
recurring
basis
include
cash
and
cash
equivalents,
restricted
cash,
short-term
debt,
accounts\npayable,
and
other
current
liabilities
and
are
reflected
in
the
financial
statements
at
cost.
Cost
approximates
fair
value
for
these
items
due
to
their
short-term
nature.\nContingent
Earnout
Shares
Liability\nThe
Company
has
a
contingent
obligation
to
issue
shares
of
Common
Stock
to
certain
stockholders
and
employees
upon
the
achievement
of
certain
market
share
price\nmilestones
within
specified
periods
(the
“Earnout
Shares”).
The
Company
determined
that
the
right
to
Earnout
Shares
represents
as
a
contingent
liability
that
meets
the
definition
of\na
derivative
and
recognized
it
on
the
balance
sheet
at
its
fair
value
upon
the
grant
date.
The
right
to
Earnout
Shares
is
remeasured
at
fair
value
each
period
through
earnings.
The
fair\nvalue
is
determined
using
Level
3
inputs,
since
estimating
the
fair
value
of
this
contingent
liability
requires
the
use
of
significant
and
subjective
inputs
that
may
and
are
likely
to\nchange
over
the
duration
of
the
liability
with
related
changes
in
internal
and
external
market
factors.
The
tranches
were
valued
using
a
Monte
Carlo
simulation
of
the
stock
prices\nusing
an
expected
volatility
assumption
based
on
the
historical
volatility
of
the
price
of
the
Company’s
stock
and
implied
volatility
derived
from
the
price
of
exchange
traded\noptions
on
the
Company’s
stock.
Upon
the
occurrence
of
a
bankruptcy
or
liquidation,
any
unissued
Earnout
Shares
would
be
fully
issued
regardless
of
whether
the

the
Company
also

After
all

the
Company\nconcludes

diluted
net

Price
for
a
period
of\nfive

Operating
leases\nThe
Company
has
entered
into
various
operating
lease
agreements
for
office
and
manufacturing
spaces.\nMichigan
Lease\nOn
October
20,
2021,
the
Company
entered
into
a
real
estate
lease
for
office
space
(""Michigan
office
lease"")
and
research
and
development
space
(""Michigan
R&D
lease"")\nlocated
in
Auburn
Hills,
Michigan
(collectively
the
“Michigan
lease”).
The
Michigan
lease
contains
one
option
to
extend
the
term
for
an
additional
five
years.
At
the
inception
of\nthe
lease,
it
was
not
reasonably
certain
we
would
exercise
the
option
to
extend
the
term
of
the
lease.\nThe
Company
gained
control
of
the
underlying
assets
under
the
Michigan
lease
in
2022.
The
Michigan
lease
expires
on
January
31,
2033
and
is
classified
as
an
operating\nlease.\nArkansas
Facility
Lease\nOn
January
21,
2022,
the
Company
entered
into
a
real
estate
lease
for
its
industrialization
facility
in
Bentonville,
Arkansas
(""Bentonville
lease"").
The
original
lease
term
is\n10
years
and
commenced
on
February
1,
2022.
The
Bentonville
lease
contains
an
option
to
extend
the
term
for
10
years
and
is
classified
as
an
operating
lease.
At
the
inception
of\nthe
lease,
it
was
not
reasonably
certain
we
would
exercise
any
of
the
options
to
extend
the
term
of
the
leases.\nOklahoma
Battery
Manufacturing
Facility
Lease\nOn
November
1,
2022,
the
Company
entered
into
a
commercial
lease
of
approximately
100,000
square
foot
manufacturing
facility
located
in
the
MidAmerica
Industrial\nPark
in
Pryor,
Oklahoma
with
the
Oklahoma
Ordnance
Works
Authority
for
the
assembly
of
its
proprietary
battery
modules.
The
lease
term
is
approximately
10
years
with
lessee\'s\nright
to
terminate
after
5
years.Lease
Portfolio\nThe
Company
uses
an
estimated
incremental
borrowing
rate
based
on
information
available
at
lease
commencement
to
determine
the
present
value
of
lease
payments\nwhen
the
rate
implicit
in
the
lease
is
not
readily
determinable.
The
weighted
average
discount
rate
used
was
6.72%.
As
of
December
31,
2022
the
remaining
operating
lease
ROU\nasset
and
operating
lease
liability
were
approximately
$39.3
million
and
$40.8
million,
respectively.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
operating
lease
ROU
asset
and
operating
lease\nliability
were
approximately
$14.2
million
and
$14.6
million,
respectively.
As
of
December
31,
2022
and
December
31,
2021,
$2.2
million
and
$0.8
million,
respectively,
of
the\nlease
liability
was
determined
to
be
short
term
and
was
included
in
accrued
expenses
and
other
current
liabilities
within
the
consolidated
balance
sheets.\nRelated
party
lease
expense
related
to
the
Company\'s
leases
in
Justin,
Texas
and
Torrance,
California
were
$0.5
million
and
$1.3
million
for
the
year
ended
December
31,\n2022
and
December
31,
2021,
respectively.
In
June
2021,
the
Torrance
lease
property
was
sold
to
a
non-related
party
lessor.
The
change
in
lessor
did
not
impact
the
terms
and\nconditions
of
the
Torrance
lease.
As
such,
payments
made
to
the
new
landlord
after
June
2021
are
no
longer
considered
as
a
related
party
lease
expense.\nCertain
lease
agreements
also
provide
the
Company
with
the
option
to
renew
for
additional
periods.
These
renewal
options
are
not
considered
in
the
remaining
lease
term\nunless
its
reasonably
certain
that
the
Company
will
exercise
such
options.
The
weighted
average
remaining
lease
term
at
December
31,
2022
and
December
31,
2021
was
9.7
years\nand
10.7
years,
respectively.\nThroughout
the
term
of
the
lease
agreements,
the
Company
is
responsible
for
paying
certain
operating
costs,
in
addition
to
rent,
such
as
common
area
maintenance,
taxes,\nutilities,
and
insurance.
These
additional
charges
are
considered
variable
lease
costs
and
are
recognized
in
the
period
which
costs
are
incurred.

April
2,
2021
and
April
9,
2021,
the
Company
was
named
as
a
defendant
in
putative
class
action
complaints
filed
in
California
on
behalf
of
individuals
who
purchased\nor
acquired
shares
of
the
Company’s
stock
during
a
specified
period.
Through
the
complaint,
plaintiffs
are
seeking,
among
other
things,
compensatory
damages.
On
February
28,\n2023,
the
court
granted
the
Company’s
motion
to
dismiss
with
leave
to
amend.
On
March
10,
2023,
the
lead
plaintiff
filed
a
second
amended
consolidated
complaint.
On
March
23,\n2023,
the
court
entered
a
stipulated
order
setting
a
briefing
schedule
on
the
Company’s
anticipated
motion
to
dismiss
the
second
amended
consolidated
complaint.
The
final\ndeterminations
of
liability
arising
from
these
litigation
matters
will
only
be
made
following
comprehensive
investigations
and
litigation
processes.\nOn
June
25,
2021,
the
Company
was
named
as
a
nominal
defendant
in
a
stockholder
derivative
complaint
filed
in
Delaware.
Through
the
stockholder
derivative
complaint,\nthe
plaintiff
asserted
claims
against
certain
of
the
Company’s
current
and
former
officers
and
directors
and
seeking,
among
other
things,
damages.
On
September
7,
2022,
the
court\ngranted
the
defendants’
motion
to
dismiss
the
stockholder
derivative
complaint,
dismissed
the
plaintiff’s
claims
without
prejudice,
and
closed
the
case.\nOn
April
29,
2021,
the
SEC’s
Division
of
Enforcement
advised
that
it
has
opened
an
investigation
related
to,
among
other
things,
HCAC’s
initial
public
offering,
HCAC’s\nmerger
with
the
Company
and
the
concurrent
private
investment
in
public
equity
offering,
historical
movements
in
the
Company,
the
Company’s
operations,
business
model,\nrevenues,
revenue
strategy,
customer
agreements,
earnings,
and
other
related
topics,
along
with
the
recent
departures
of
certain
of
the
Company’s
officers.
The
Staff
of
the
SEC\'s\nDivision
of
Enforcement
(the
""Staff"")
informed
the
Company
that
it
has
concluded
its
investigation
and
believes
that
certain
former
senior
executives
of
the
company
misled\ninvestors
in
late
2020
and
early
2021
regarding
2021
and
2022
projections
of
revenue
from
a
pipeline
of
engineering
services
projects,
violating
Section
17(a)
of
the
Securities
Act\nand
Section
10(b)
of
the
Exchange
Act
and
Rule
10b-5
promulgated
thereunder.
In
March
2021,
when
new
leadership
of
the
Company
decided
to
discontinue
engineering
services\nas
a
potential
revenue
stream,
these
projections
were
revised
to
zero.
The
Staff
also
believes
that
a
former
senior
executive
received
a
payment
of
nearly
$1
million
from
the\ncompany’s
former
owners
in
the
Fall
of
2020
that
was
not
properly
disclosed,
violating
Sections
13(a)
and
14(a)
of
the
Exchange
Act
and
Rules
13a-11
and
14a-9
promulgated\nthereunder.
Finally,
the
Staff
believes
that
Canoo
is
liable
for
the
conduct
of
these
former
senior
executives.
While
not
admitting
to
the
Staff’s
findings,
the
Company
has
decided
to\nresolve
the
Staff’s
investigation
into
the
Company
by
agreeing
in
principle
with
the
Staff
to
a
cease
and
desist
order
and
payment
of
a
$1.5
million
penalty,
payable
in
equal\ninstallments
of
$0.4
million
over
each
of
the
next
four
quarters
beginning
in
the
second
quarter
of
2023.
This
settlement
is
not,
and
cannot
be,
final
until
it
is
approved
by
a
majority\nof
the
Commissioners
of
the
SEC.
The
Company
understands
that
the
Staff’s
investigation
into
certain
former
senior
executives
is
ongoing.\nIn
March
2022,
the
Company
received
demand
letters
on
behalf
of
shareholders
of
the

Investigation\nThe
Staff
of
the
Division
of
Enforcement
(the
""Staff"")
informed
the
Company
that
it
has
concluded
its
investigation
and
believes
that
certain
former
senior
executives
of\nthe
company
misled
investors
in
late
2020
and
early
2021
regarding
2021
and
2022
projections
of
revenue
from
a
pipeline
of
engineering
services
projects,
violating
Section
17(a)\nof
the
Securities
Act
and
Section
10(b)
of
the
Exchange
Act
and
Rule
10b-5
promulgated
thereunder.
In
March
2021,
when
new
leadership
of
the
Company
decided
to
discontinue\nengineering
services
as
a
potential
revenue
stream,
these
projections
were
revised
to
zero.
The
Staff
also
believes
that
a
former
senior
executive
received
a
payment
of
nearly\n$1
million
from
the
company’s
former
owners
in
the
Fall
of
2020
that
was
not
properly
disclosed,
violating
Sections
13(a)
and
14(a)
of
the
Exchange
Act
and
Rules
13a-11
and\n14a-9
promulgated
thereunder.
Finally,
the
Staff
believes
that
Canoo
is
liable
for
the
conduct
of
these
former
senior
executives.
While
not
admitting
to
the
Staff’s
findings,
the\ncompany
has
decided
to
resolve
the
Staff’s
investigation
into
the
Company
by
agreeing
in
principle
with
the
Staff
to
a
cease
and
desist
order
and
payment
of
a
$1.5
million
penalty,\npayable
in
equal
installments
of
$375,000
over
each
of
the
next
four
quarters
beginning
in
the
second
quarter
of
2023.
This
settlement
is
not,
and
cannot
be,
final
until
it
is
approved\nby
a
majority
of
the
Commissioners
of
the
SEC.
The
Company
understands
that
the
Staff’s
investigation
into
certain
former
senior
executives
is
ongoing.\nPurchase

of
approximately

CHANGES
IN
AND
DISAGREEMENTS
WITH
ACCOUNTANTS
ON
ACCOUNTING
AND
FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM
9A.
CONTROLS
AND
PROCEDURES\nEvaluation
of
Disclosure
Controls
and
Procedures\nOur
management,
with
the
participation
of
our
Executive
Chair
and
Chief
Executive
Officer,
(""CEO"")
and
Chief
Financial
Officer
(""CFO"")
has
evaluated
the
effectiveness\nof
our
disclosure
controls
and
procedures
as
of
December
31,
2022.
We
have
established
and
currently
maintain
disclosure
controls
and
procedures,
as
such
term
is
defined
in
Rules\n13a-15(e)
and
15d-15(e)
of
the
Exchange
Act,
designed
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
information
required
to
be
disclosed
in
our
reports
filed
under
the
Exchange
Act,
is\nrecorded,
processed,
summarized
and
reported
within
the
time
periods
specified
in
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission’s
rules
and
forms,
and
that
such
information
is\naccumulated
and
communicated
to
management,
including
our
principal
executive
officer
and
principal
financial
officer,
as
appropriate,
to
allow
for
timely
decisions
regarding\nrequired
disclosure.
In
designing
and
evaluating
disclosure
controls
and
procedures,
management
recognized
that
any
controls
and
procedures,
no
matter
how
well
designed
and\noperated,
can
provide
only
reasonable
assurance
of
achieving
the
desired
control
objectives,
and
management
necessarily
was
required
to
apply
its
judgment
in
evaluating
the
cost-\nbenefit
relationship
of
possible
controls
and
procedures.\nBased
on
an
evaluation
of
our
disclosure
controls
and
procedures,
our
CEO
and
CFO
concluded
that
our
disclosure
controls
and
procedures
were
effective
at
a
reasonable\nassurance
level
as
of
December
31,
2022.\nManagement’s
Report
on
Internal
Control
Over
Financial
Reporting\nManagement,
under
the
supervision
of
our
CEO
and
CFO,
is
responsible
for
establishing
and
maintaining
adequate
internal
control
over
our
financial
reporting,
as
defined\nin
Rules
13a-15(f)
and
15(d)-15(f)
under
the
Exchange
Act.
Our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
is
designed
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
regarding
the
reliability
of\nfinancial
reporting
and
the
preparation
of
financial
statements
for
external
purposes
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles.
Our
management,
under
the\nsupervision
of
our
CEO
and
CFO,
evaluated
the
design
and
operating
effectiveness
of
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
based
on
the
criteria
established
in
the
Internal\nControl-Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued
by
the
Committee
of
Sponsoring
Organizations
of
the
Treadway
Commission
(the
""2013
COSO
framework"").
Based
on
this\nevaluation,
our
management
concluded
that
we
maintained
effective
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
as
of
December
31,
2022.\nAll
internal
control
systems,
no
matter
how
well
designed,
have
inherent
limitations.
Accordingly
even
effective
internal
controls
and
procedures
can
provide
only\nreasonable
assurance
with
respect
to
financial
statement
preparation
and
presentation.
Also,
projections
of
any
evaluation
of
effectiveness
to
future
periods
are
subject
to
the
risk\nthat
controls
may
become
inadequate
because
of
changes
in
conditions,
or
that
the
degree
of
compliance
with
the
policies
or
procedures
may
deteriorate.\nChanges
in
Internal
Control
Over
Financial
Reporting\nThere
were
no
changes
to
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
during
the
quarter
ended
December
31,
2022
that
have
materially
affected,
or
are
reasonably
likely
to\nmaterially
affect,
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting.\nITEM

Forward-Looking
Statements\nThis
Quarterly
Report
on
Form
10-Q,
including,
without
limitation,
statements
under
the
heading
“Management’s
Discussion
and
Analysis
of
Financial
Condition
and\nResults
of
Operations,”
contains
forward-looking
statements
within
the
meaning
of
Section
27A
of
the
Securities
Act
of
1933,
as
amended,
or
the
Securities
Act,
and
Section
21E
of\nthe
Securities
Exchange
Act
of
1934,
as
amended,
or
the
Exchange
Act.
We
have
based
these
forward-looking
statements
on
our
current
expectations
and
projections
about
future\nevents.
All
statements,
other
than
statements
of
present
or
historical
fact
included
in
this
Quarterly
Report
on
Form
10-Q
are
forward-looking
statements.
In
some
cases,
you
can\nidentify
forward-looking
statements
by
terminology
such
as
“anticipate,”
“believe,”
“continue,”
“could,”
“estimate,”
“expect,”
“intends,”
“may,”
“might,”
“plan,”
“possible,”\n“potential,”
“predict,”
“project,”
“should,”
“will,”
“would”
or
the
negative
of
such
terms
or
other
similar
expressions.
These
forward-looking
statements
are
subject
to
known
and\nunknown
risks,
uncertainties
and
assumptions
about
us
that
may
cause
our
actual
results,
levels
of
activity,
performance
or
achievements
to
be
materially
different
from
any
future\nresults,
levels
of
activity,
performance
or
achievements
expressed
or
implied
by
such
forward-looking
statements.
\nThese
statements
are
subject
to
known
and
unknown
risks,
uncertainties
and
assumptions,
many
of
which
are
difficult
to
predict
and
are
beyond
our
control
and
could\ncause
actual
results
to
differ
materially
from
those
projected
or
otherwise
implied
by
the
forward-looking
statements.
Below
is
a
summary
of
certain
material
factors
that
may
make\nan
investment
in
our
common
stock
speculative
or
risky.\n•\nWe
are
an
early
stage
company
with
a
history
of
losses
and
expect
to
incur
significant
expenses
and
continuing
losses
for
the
foreseeable
future.\n•\nWe
may
be
unable
to
adequately
control
the
costs
associated
with
our
operations.\n•\nOur
current
business
plans
require
a
significant
amount
of
capital.
If
we
are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
funding
or
do
not
have
access
to
capital,
we
will
be
unable
to\nexecute
our
business
plans
and
our
prospects,
financial
condition
and
results
of
operations
could
be
materially
adversely
affected.\n•\nOur
management
has
performed
an
analysis
of
our
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
and
has
identified
substantial
doubt
about
our
ability
to
continue
as
a
going\nconcern.
If
we
are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
additional
funding
or
do
not
have
access
to
additional
capital,
we
will
be
unable
to
execute
our
business
plans
and
could
be\nrequired
to
terminate
or
significantly
curtail
our
operations.\n•\nWe
have
been
notified
by
The
Nasdaq
Stock
Market
LLC
of
our
failure
to
comply
with
certain
continued
listing
requirements
and,
if
we
are
unable
to
regain\ncompliance
with
all
applicable
continued
listing
requirements
and
standards
of
Nasdaq,
our
Common
Stock
could
be
delisted
from
Nasdaq,
which
would
have
an\nadverse
impact
on
the
trading,
liquidity,
and
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock.\n•\nThe
issuance
of
shares
of
our
Common
Stock
upon
the
conversion
and/or
exercise
of
the
securities
issued
pursuant
to
the
Yorkville
Convertible
Debentures,

will
continue
to
increase
the
number
of
shares
eligible
for
future
resale
in
the
public

and
result
in

to
our
stockholders.\n•\nAdverse
developments
affecting
the
financial
services
industry,
such
as
actual
events
or
concerns
involving
liquidity,
defaults
or
non-performance
by
financial\ninstitutions
could
adversely
affect
our
current
financial
condition
and
projected
business
operations.\n•\nWe
have
not
achieved
positive
operating
cash
flow
and,
given
our
projected
funding
needs,
our
ability
to
generate
positive
cash
flow
is
uncertain.\n•\nOur
financial
results
may
vary
significantly
from
period
to
period
due
to
fluctuations
in
our
operating
costs,
product
demand
and
other
factors.\n•\nOur
limited
operating
history
makes
evaluating
our
business
and
future
prospects
difficult
and
increases
the
risk
of
your
investment.\n•\nWe
previously
identified
material
weaknesses
in
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting.
Although
the
weaknesses
previously
identified
have
been
remediated,
if\nwe
identify
additional
material
weaknesses
in
the
future
or
otherwise
fail
to
maintain
an
effective
system
of
internal
controls,
we
may
not
be
able
to
accurately
or
timely\nreport
our
financial
condition
or
results
of
operations,
which
may
adversely
affect
our
business
and
stock
price.\n•\nIf
we
fail
to
manage
our
growth
effectively,
we
may
not
be
able
to
design,
develop,
manufacture,
market
and
launch
our
EVs
successfully.\n•\nWe
are
highly
dependent
on
the
services
of
our
key
employees
and
senior
management
and,
if
we
are
unable
to
attract
and
retain
key
employees
and
hire
qualified\nmanagement,
technical
and
EV
engineering
personnel,
our
ability
to
compete
could
be
harmed.\n•\nWe
face
significant
barriers
to
manufacture
and
bring
our
EVs
to
market,
and
if
we
cannot
successfully
overcome
those
barriers
our
business
will
be
negatively\nimpacted.\n•\nCustomers
who
have
committed
to
purchase
significant
amounts
of
our
vehicles
may
purchase
significantly
fewer
vehicles
than
we
currently
anticipate
or
none
at
all.
In\nthat
case,
we
will
not
realize
the
revenue
we
expect
from
these
customers.\n•\nOur
ability
to
develop
and
manufacture
EVs
of
sufficient
quality
and
appeal
to
customers
on
schedule
and
on
a
large
scale
is
unproven
and
still
evolving.\n•\nWe
will
depend
initially
on
revenue
generated
from
a
single
EV
model
and
in
the
foreseeable
future
will
be
significantly
dependent
on
a
limited
number
of
models.\n•\nThere
is
no
guarantee
that
we
will
be
able
to
develop
our
software
platform,
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
or
that
if
we
are
able
to
develop
it,
that
we
will
obtain
the
revenue\nand
other
benefits
we
expect
from
it.\n•\nWe
may
fail
to
attract
new
customers
in
sufficient
numbers
or
at
sufficient
rates
or
at
all
or
to
retain
existing
customers.\n•\nIf
our
EVs
fail
to
perform
as
expected,
our
ability
to
develop,
market
and
deploy
our
EVs
could
be
harmed.\n•\nOur
distribution
model
may
expose
us
to
risk
and
if
unsuccessful
may
impact
our
business
prospects
and
results
of
operations.\n•\nWe
face
legal,
regulatory
and
legislative
uncertainty
in
how
our
go-to-market
models
will
be
interpreted
under
existing
and
future
law,
including
the
potential
inability\nto
protect
our
intellectual
property
rights,
and
we
may
be
required
to
adjust
our
consumer
business
model
in
certain
jurisdictions
as
a
result.\n4\n',

Description
of
the

(“Canoo”
or

“Company”)
is
a
high-tech
advanced

technology
company
with
a
mission
to
bring
electric
vehicles
(""EVs"")
to
everyone.
We
have\ndeveloped
a
breakthrough
EV
platform
that
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
rapidly
innovate
and
bring
new
products
addressing
multiple
use

to

faster
than
our\ncompetition

Basis
of
Presentation
and
Summary
of
Significant
Accounting
Policies\nBasis
of
Presentation
and
Principles
of
Consolidation\nThe
Company\'s
unaudited
condensed
consolidated
financial
statements
have
been
prepared
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
SEC
and
accounting\nprinciples
generally
accepted
in
the
United
States
of
America
(“GAAP”)
for
interim
reporting.
Accordingly,
certain
notes
or
other
information
that
are
normally
required
by
GAAP\nhave
been
omitted
if
they
substantially
duplicate
the
disclosures
contained
in
the
Company’s
annual
audited
consolidated
financial
statements.
Accordingly,
the
unaudited\ncondensed
consolidated
financial
statements
should
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
Company’s
audited
financial
statements
and
related
notes
included
in
the
Company\'s
Annual\nReport
on
Form
10-K
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2022,
filed
with
the
SEC
on
March
30,
2023
(“Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K”).
Results
of
operations
reported
for
interim\nperiods
are
not
necessarily
indicative
of
results
for
the
entire
year.
In
the
opinion
of
management,
the
Company
has
made
all
adjustments
necessary
to
present
fairly
its
condensed\nconsolidated
financial
statements
for
the
periods
presented.
Such
adjustments
are
of
a
normal,
recurring
nature.
The
Company’s
financial
statements
have
been
prepared
under
the\nassumption
that
the
Company
will
continue
as
a
going
concern,
which
contemplates
the
realization
of
assets
and
discharge
of
liabilities
in
the
normal
course
of
business
for
the\nforeseeable
future.\nThe
accompanying
unaudited
condensed
consolidated
financial
statements
include
the
results
of
the
Company
and
its
subsidiaries.
The
Company’s
comprehensive
loss
is\nthe
same
as
its
net
loss.\nExcept
for
any
updates
below,
no
material
changes
have
occurred
with
respect
to
the
Company’s
significant
accounting
policies
disclosed
in
Note
2
of
the
Notes
to
the\nConsolidated
Financial
Statements
in
Part
II,
Item
8
of
the
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K.\nLiquidity
and
Capital
Resources\nAs
of
September
30,
2023,
the
Company’s
principal
sources
of
liquidity
are
its
unrestricted
cash
balance
of
$8.3
million
and
its
access
to
capital
under
the
ATM
Offering\n(as
defined
in
Note
13)
and
Yorkville
facilities
(as
defined
in
Note
9).
The
Company
has
incurred
losses
since
inception
and
had
negative
cash
flow
from
operating
activities
of\n$191.4
million
for
the
nine
months
ended
September
30,
2023.
The
Company
expects
to
continue
to
incur
net
losses
and
negative
cash
flows
from
operating
activities
in
accordance\nwith
its
operating
plan
and
expects
that
both
capital
and
operating
expenditures
will
increase
significantly
in
connection
with
its
ongoing
activities.
These
conditions
and
events\nraise
substantial
doubt
about
the
Company’s
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern.\nAs
an
early-stage
growth
company,
the
Company’s
ability
to
access
capital
is
critical.
Although
management
continues
to
explore
raising
additional
capital
through
a\ncombination
of
debt
financing,
other
non-dilutive
financing
and/or
equity
financing
to
supplement
the
Company’s
capitalization
and
liquidity,
management
cannot
conclude
as
of\nthe
date
of
this
filing
that
its
plans
are
probable
of
being
successfully
implemented.
The
condensed
consolidated
interim
financial
information
does
not
include
any
adjustments
that\nmight
result
from
the
outcome
of
this
uncertainty.\nThe
Company
believes
substantial
doubt
exists
about
the
Company’s
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
for
twelve
months
from
the
date
of
issuance
of
our
financial\nstatements.\nMacroeconomic
Conditions\nCurrent
adverse
macroeconomic
conditions,
including
but
not
limited
to
heightened
inflation,
slower
growth
or
recession,
changes
to
fiscal
and
monetary
policy,
higher\ninterest
rates,
currency
fluctuations,
challenges
in
the
supply
chain
could
negatively
affect
our
business.\n13\n',

Document(page_content=""Table
of
Contents\nUltimately,
the
Company
cannot
predict
the
impact
of
current
or
worsening
macroeconomic
conditions.
The
Company
continues
to
monitor
macroeconomic
conditions
to\nremain
flexible
and
to
optimize
and
evolve
its
business
as
appropriate.
To
do
this,
the
Company
is
working
on
projecting
demand
and
infrastructure
requirements
and
deploying
its\nworkforce
and
other
resources
accordingly.\nProperty
and
Equipment,
net\nConstruction-in-progress
is
stated
at
historical
cost
and
is
transferred
to
its
respective
depreciable
asset
class
once
the
underlying
asset
is
ready
for
its
intended
use.\nDepreciation
of
construction-in-progress
begins
only
once
placed
into
service,
over
the
estimated
useful
life
on
a
straight-line
basis.
Useful
life
determination
requires
significant\njudgment.\nFair
Value
of
Financial
Instruments\nThe
Company
applies
the
provisions
of
ASC
820,
Fair
Value
Measurements
and
Disclosures,
which
provides
a
single
authoritative
definition
of
fair
value,
sets
out
a\nframework
for
measuring
fair
value
and
expands
on
required
disclosures
about
fair
value
measurement.
Fair
value
represents
the
exchange
price
that
would
be
received
for
an
asset\nor
paid
to
transfer
a
liability
in
the
principal
or
most
advantageous
market
for
the
asset
or
liability
in
an
orderly
transaction
between
market
participants
on
the
measurement
date.\nThe
Company
uses
the
following
hierarchy
in
measuring
the
fair
value
of
the
Company’s
assets
and
liabilities,
focusing
on
the
most
observable
inputs
when
available:\n•\nLevel
1
Quoted
prices
in
active
markets
for
identical
assets
or
liabilities.\n•\nLevel
2
Observable
inputs
other
than
Level
1
quoted
prices,
such
as
quoted
prices
for
similar
assets
and
liabilities
in
active
markets,
quoted
prices
in
markets
that
are\nnot
active
for
identical
or
similar
assets
and
liabilities,
or
other
inputs
that
are
observable
or
can
be
corroborated
by
observable
market
data
for
substantially
the
full
term\nof
the
assets
or
liabilities.\n•\nLevel
3
Valuations
are
based
on
inputs
that
are
unobservable
and
significant
to
the
overall
fair
value
measurement
of
the
assets
or
liabilities.
Inputs
reflect\nmanagement’s
best
estimate
of
what
market
participants
would
use
in
pricing
the
asset
or
liability
at
the
measurement
date.
Consideration
is
given
to
the
risk
inherent
in\nthe
valuation
technique
and
the
risk
inherent
in
the
inputs
to
the
model.\nValuation
techniques
used
to
measure
fair
value
must
maximize
the
use
of
observable
inputs
and
minimize
the
use
of
unobservable
inputs.\nThe
Company's
financial
assets
and
liabilities
not
measured
at
fair
value
on
a
recurring
basis
include
cash
and
cash
equivalents,
restricted
cash,
short-term
debt,
accounts\npayable,
and
other
current
liabilities
and
are
reflected
in
the
financial
statements
at
cost.
Cost
approximates
fair
value
for
these
items
due
to
their
short-term
nature.\nContingent
Earnout
Shares
Liability\nThe
Company
has
a
contingent
obligation
to
issue
shares
of
Common
Stock
to
certain
stockholders
and
employees
upon
the
achievement
of
certain
market
share
price\nmilestones
within
specified
periods
(the
“Earnout
Shares”).
The
Company
determined
that
the
right
to
Earnout
Shares
represents
a
contingent
liability
that
meets
the
definition
of
a\nderivative
and
recognized
it
on
the
balance
sheet
at
its
fair
value
upon
the
grant
date.
The
right
to
Earnout
Shares
is
remeasured
at
fair
value
each
period
through
earnings.
The
fair\nvalue
is
determined
using
Level
3
inputs,
since
estimating
the
fair
value
of
this
contingent
liability
requires
the
use
of
significant
and
subjective
inputs
that
may
and
are
likely
to\nchange
over
the
duration
of
the
liability
with
related
changes
in
internal
and
external
market
factors.
The
tranches
were
valued
using
a
Monte
Carlo
simulation
of
the
stock
prices\nusing
an
expected
volatility
assumption
based
on
the
historical
volatility
of
the
price
of
the
Company’s
stock
and
implied
volatility
derived
from
the
price
of
exchange
traded\noptions
on
the
Company’s
stock.
Upon
the
occurrence
of
a
bankruptcy
or
liquidation,
any
unissued
Earnout
Shares
would
be
fully
issued
regardless
of
whether
the
share
price
target\nhas
been
met.\nConvertible
Debt\nThe
Company
accounts
for
convertible
debt
that
does
not
meet
the
criteria
for
equity
treatment
in
accordance
with
the
guidance
contained
in

Contracts
in
an
Entity’s
Own
Equity.
Accordingly,
the
Company
elected
to
classify
the
April
Convertible
Debenture
(defined
below)
as
a
liability
at
amortized
cost
using
the\neffective
interest
method.
The
Company
classifies
convertible
debt
based
on
the
re-payment
terms
and
conditions.
Any
discounts
or
premiums
on
the
convertible
debt
and
costs\nincurred
upon
issuance
of
the
convertible
debt
are
amortized
to
interest
expense
over
the
terms
of
the
related
convertible
debt.
Convertible
debt
is
also
analyzed
for
the
existence
of\nembedded
derivatives,
which
may
require
bifurcation
from
the
convertible
debt
and
separate
accounting
treatment.
For
derivative
financial
instruments
that
are
accounted
for
as\nassets
or
liabilities,
the
derivative

reported
in
the\ncondensed
consolidated
statements
of
operations.
The
variable
conversion
feature
of
the
convertible
debenture
is
considered
a
derivative.
Refer
to
Note
9
for
further
information.\nThe
Company
has
elected
the
fair
value
option
to
account
for
the
July
Convertible
Debenture,
the
August
Convertible
Debenture
and
the
September
Convertible
Debenture\n(each,
as
defined
in
Note
9).
The
Company
recorded
the
Convertible
Debentures
(as
defined
in
Note
9)
at
fair
value
upon
issuance.
The
Company
records
changes
in
fair
value
in
the\ncondensed
consolidated
statements
of
operations,
with
the
exception
of
changes
in
fair

due
to
instrument-specific
credit
risk
which,
if
present,
will
be
recorded
as
a

other
comprehensive

Interest
expense
related
to

is
included
in
the

As
a
result
of
applying
the
fair
value
option,
direct\ncosts
and
fees
related
to
the
Convertible
Debentures
were
expensed
as
incurred.\nWarrants\nThe
Company
determines
the
accounting
classification
of
warrants
it
issues
as
either
liability
or
equity
classified
by
first
assessing
whether
the
warrants
meet
liability\nclassification
in
accordance
with
ASC
480-10,
Accounting
for
Certain
Financial
Instruments
with
Characteristics
of
both
Liabilities
and
Equity
(""ASC
480""),
then
in
accordance\nwith
ASC
815-40
(""ASC
815""),
Accounting
for
Derivative
Financial
Instruments
Indexed
to,
and
Potentially
Settled
in,
a
Company’s
Own
Stock.
Under
ASC
480,
warrants
are\nconsidered
liability
classified
if
the
warrants
are
mandatorily
redeemable,
obligate
the
Company
to
settle
the
warrants
or
the
underlying
shares
by
paying
cash
or
other
assets,
or\nwarrants
that
must
or
may
require
settlement
by
issuing
variable
number
of
shares.
If
warrants
do
not
meet
liability
classification
under
ASC
480,
the
Company
assesses
the\nrequirements
under
ASC
815,
which
states
that
contracts
that
require
or
may
require
the
issuer
to
settle
the
contract
for
cash
are
liabilities
recorded
at
fair
value,
irrespective
of
the\nlikelihood
of
the
transaction
occurring
that
triggers
the
net
cash
settlement
feature.
If
the
warrants
do
not
require
liability
classification
under
ASC
815,
and
in
order
to
conclude\nequity
classification,
the
Company
also
assesses
whether
the
warrants
are
indexed
to
its
common
stock
and
whether
the
warrants
are
classified
as
equity
under
ASC
815
or
other\napplicable
GAAP.
After
all
relevant
assessments,
the
Company
concludes
whether
the
warrants
are
classified
as
liability
or
equity.
Liability
classified
warrants
require
fair
value\naccounting
at
issuance
and
subsequent
to
initial
issuance
with
all
changes
in
fair
value
after
the
issuance
date
recorded
in
the
statements
of
operations.
Equity
classified
warrants\nonly
require
fair
value
accounting
at
issuance
with
no
changes
recognized
subsequent
to
the
issuance
date.
Refer
to
Note
15
for
information
regarding
the
warrants
issued.\nRevenue
Recognition\nThe
Company
applies
ASC
606,
which
governs
how
the
Company
recognizes
revenue.
Under
ASC
606,
the
Company
recognizes
revenue
when
the
Company
transfers\npromised
goods
or
services
to
customers
in
an
amount
that
reflects
the
consideration
to
which
the
Company
expects
to
be
entitled
in
exchange
for
those
goods
or
services.
The\nCompany
recognizes
revenue
pursuant
to
the
five-step
framework
contained
in
ASC
606:
(i)
identify
the
contract
with
a
customer;
(ii)
identify
the
performance
obligations
in
the\ncontract,
including
whether
they
are
distinct
in
the
context
of
the
contract;
(iii)
determine
the
transaction
price,
including
the
constraint
on
variable
consideration;
(iv)
allocate
the\ntransaction
price
to
the
performance
obligations
in
the
contract;
and
(v)
recognize
revenue
when
(or
as)
the
Company
satisfies
the
performance
obligations.\nRevenues
include
vehicle
revenues
resulting
from
the
delivery
of
our
vehicles
to
our
customers
as
well
as
revenues
derived
from
other
streams
including
battery
modules,\nand
engineering
services
to
our
customers.
The
Company
recognizes
revenue
related
to
the
vehicles
at
a
point
in
time
when
the
customer
obtains
control
of
the
vehicle
either
upon\ncompletion
of
delivery
or
upon
pick
up
of
the
vehicle
by
the
customer.
The
Company
recognizes
revenue
from
the
provision
of
consulting
services
on
a
project
basis.
The\nCompany\'s
fixed
price
contracts
related
to
these
services
contain
a
single
performance
obligation.
Revenue
for
these
services
is
recognized
at
a
point
in
time
as
different
phases
of\nthe
project
are
delivered.\nCost
of
Revenue\nCost
of
revenues
primarily
relates
to
the
cost
of
production
of
vehicles
and
includes
direct
parts,
material
and
labor
costs,
machinery
and
tooling
depreciation,
amortization\nof
capitalized
manufacturing
costs,
shipping
and
logistics
costs,
adjustments
to
write
down
the
carrying
value
of
inventory
when
it
exceeds
its
estimated
net
realizable
value\n15\n',

revenue
also
includes
materials,
labor,
and
other
direct
costs
related
to
the
development\nof
battery
modules
and
provision
of

services.\nNet
loss
per
Share\nBasic
and
diluted
net
loss
per
share
is
computed
by
dividing
net
loss
by
the
weighted-average
number
of
the
Company\'s
common
shares
outstanding
during
the
period,\nwithout
consideration
for
potential
dilutive
securities.
As
the
Company
is
in
a
loss
position
for
the
periods
presented,
diluted
net
loss
per
share
is
the
same
as
basic
net
loss
per\nshare,
since
the
effects
of
potentially
dilutive
securities
are
antidilutive.\n3.

The
initial
lease
term
is
three
years,
five
months,
commencing
on
November
1,
2022
and
terminating
on
March
31,
2026,
with
one
option
to
extend
the
term
of
the
lease\nfor
an
additional
five
years.
Prior
to
execution,
the
contract
was
a
month-to-month
arrangement.
The
total
minimum
lease
payments
over
the
initial
lease
term
is
$0.3
million.\nOklahoma
Manufacturing
Facility
Lease\nOn
November
9,
2022,
the
Company
entered
into
a
PSA
with
Terex
for
the
purchase
of
approximately
630,000
square
foot
vehicle
manufacturing
facility
on
approximately\n121
acres
in
Oklahoma
City,
Oklahoma.
On
April
7,
2023,
pursuant
to
the
assignment
of
real
estate
purchase
agreement,
the
Company
assigned
the
right
to
purchase
the
Property
to\nI-40
Partners,
a
special
purpose
vehicle
managed
by
entities
affiliated
with
the
CEO.
The
Company
then
entered
into
a
lease
agreement
with
I-40
Partners
commencing
April
7,\n2023.
The
lease
term
is
approximately
ten
years
with
a
five
year
renewal
option
and
the
minimum
aggregate
lease
payment
over
the
initial
term
is
expected
to
be
approximately\n$44.3
million,
which
includes
equity
portion
of
rent
composed
of
$1.5
million
fully
vested
non-refundable
shares.
Refer
to
Note
15
on
warrants
issued
in
conjunction
with
this\nlease.\nThe
lease
was
evaluated
as
a
sale
and
leaseback
of
real
estate
because
the
Company
was
deemed
to
control
the
asset
once
the
rights
under
the
PSA
were
assigned
to
I-40\nPartners.
We
accounted
for
the
transaction
as
a
financing
lease
since
the
lease
agreement
contains
a
repurchase
option
which
precludes
sale
and
leaseback
accounting.
The
purchase\noption
is
exercisable
between
the
third
and
fourth
anniversary
of
the
lease
commencement
in
the
greater
of
the
fair
value
or
a
150%
of
the
amounts
incurred
by
Landlord
for
the\npurchase
price
for
the
Property,
the
construction
allowance,
and
expenses
incurred
with
the
purchase
of
the
Property.\nThe
lease
did
not
qualify
for
sale-leaseback
accounting
and
was
accounted
for
as
a
financing
obligation.
Under
a
failed
sale-leaseback
transaction,
the
real
estate
assets\ngenerally
recorded
on
the
consolidated
balance
sheet
and
are
depreciated
over
their
useful
lives
while
a
failed
sale
and
leaseback
financing
obligation
is
recognized
for
the
proceeds.\nAs
a
result,
the
Company
recorded
an
asset
and
a
corresponding
finance
liability
in
the
amount
of
the
purchase
price
of
$34.2
million.
The
financing
liability
at
inception
was\ninitially
allocated
to
the
warrants
issued
to
I-40
valued
at
$0.9
million
described
in
Note
15
and
the
derivative
liability
valued
at
$0.6
million
described
in
Note
4.\nAs
described
above,
for
the
failed
sale
and
leaseback
transaction,
we
reflect
the
real
estate
asset
on
our
Balance
Sheets
in
Property
and
equipment,
net
as
if
we
were
the\nlegal
owner,
and
we
continue
to
recognize
depreciation
expense
over
the
estimated
useful
life.
We
do
not
recognize
rent
expense
related
to
the
lease,
but
we
have
recorded
a
liability\nfor
the
failed
sale
and
leaseback
obligation
and
monthly
interest
expense.
The
Company
could
not
readily
determine
the
implicit
rate
in
the
lease,
as
such
the
Company
imputed
an\ninterest
rate
of
approximately
10%.
There
have
been
no
gains
or
losses
recorded
in
connection
with
the
transactions
described
above.\nFuture
minimum
payments
under
the
failed
sale
leaseback
are
as
follows
(in
thousands):\n2023
(excluding
the
nine
months
ended
September

\nLease
Portfolio\nThe
Company
uses
an
estimated
incremental
borrowing
rate
based
on
information
available
at
lease
commencement
to
determine
the
present
value
of
lease
payments\nwhen
the
rate
implicit
in
the
lease
is
not
readily
determinable.
The
weighted
average
discount
rate
used
was
6.70%.
As
of
September
30,
2023,
the
remaining
operating
lease
ROU\nasset
and

were
approximately
$37.1

the
operating

Warrants
\nOn
July
11,
2022,
Canoo
Sales,
LLC,
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
the
Company,
entered
into
an
Electric
Vehicle
Fleet
Purchase
Agreement
(the
“Walmart
EV
Fleet\nPurchase
Agreement"")
with
Walmart.
Pursuant
to
the
Walmart
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreement,
subject
to
certain
acceptance
and
performance
criteria,
Walmart
agreed
to
purchase
at\nleast
4,500
EVs,
with
an
option
to
purchase
up
to
an
additional
5,500
EVs,
for
an
agreed
upon
capped
price
per
unit
determined
based
on
the
EV
model.
The
Walmart
EV
Fleet\nPurchase
Agreement
(excluding
any
work
order
or
purchase
order
as
a
part
thereof)
has
a
five-year
term,
unless
earlier
terminated.\nIn
connection
with
the
Walmart
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreement,
the
Company
entered
into
a
Warrant
Issuance
Agreement
with
Walmart
pursuant
to
which
the
Company\nissued
to
Walmart
a
Warrant
to
purchase
an
aggregate
of
61.2
million
shares
of
Common
Stock,
subject
to
certain
anti-dilutive
adjustments,
at
an
exercise
price
of
$2.15
per
share,\nwhich
represented
approximately
20%
ownership
in
the
Company
on
a
fully
diluted
basis
as
of
the
issuance
date.
As
a
result
of
the
anti-dilution
adjustments,
the
Warrant
is\ncurrently
exercisable
for
an
aggregate
of
64.4
million
shares
of
Common
Stock
at
a
per
share
exercise
price
of
$2.04.
The
Warrant
has
a
term
of
10
years
and
is
vested
with
respect\nto
15.3
million
shares
of
Common
Stock.
Thereafter,
the
Warrant
will
vest
quarterly
in
amounts
proportionate
with
the
net
revenue
realized
by
the
Company
from
transactions
with\nWalmart
or
its
affiliates
under
the
Walmart
EV
Fleet
Purchase
Agreement
or
enabled
by
any
other
agreement
between
the
Company
and
Walmart,
and
any
net
revenue
attributable\nto
any
products
or
services
offered
by
Walmart
or
its
affiliates
related
to
the
Company,
until
such
net
revenue
equals
$300.0
million,
at
which
time
the
Warrant
will
have
vested\nfully.\nSince
the
counterparty
is
also
a
customer,
the
issuance
of
the
Warrant
was
determined
to
be
consideration
payable
to
a
customer
within
the
scope
of
ASC

relevant
to
an
assessment
and
understanding
of
our

is
a
high-tech
advanced
mobility
technology
company
with
a
mission
to
bring
electric
vehicles
(“EVs”)
to
everyone
and
provide
connected
services
that
continually\nimprove
the
vehicle
ownership
experience
through
its
lifecycle.
We
have
developed
a
technology
and
design
platform
that
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
rapidly
innovate
and
launch\nnew
products
which
address
multiple
customer
use
cases.
Our
vehicle
architecture
and
design
philosophy
are
aimed
at
enhancing
customer
productivity
and
are
complimented
by\nour
unique
software
systems.\nWe
remain
committed
to
environmentally
friendly,
sustainable
mobility
solutions
that
are
accessible
to
everyone.
We
proudly
intend
to
manufacture
our
EVs
in
Oklahoma,\nbringing
advanced
manufacturing
and
technology
jobs
to
communities
in
America's
heartland.
We
are
committed
to
building
a
diverse
workforce
that
will
draw
heavily
upon
the\nlocal
communities
of
Native
Americans
and
veterans.\nWe
believe
we
are
one
of
the
first
automotive
manufacturers
focused
on
monetizing
value
across
the
entirety
of
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.
Our
platform\nand
data
architecture
is
purpose-built
to
be
durable
and
serve
as
the
foundation
for
the
vehicles
we
intend
to
offer.
The
foundational
layer
is
our
Multi-Purpose
Platform
(“MPP”
or\n“platform”)
architecture,
which
serves
as
the
base
of
our
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
its
Base,
Premium,
and
Adventure
trims;
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle
and\nits
130
and
190
trims;
the
Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicle
(“MPDV”)
and
the
Pickup.
The
next
layer
is
cybersecurity
which
is
embedded
in
our
vehicle
to
ensure
the
privacy
and\nprotection
of
vehicle
data.
Our
‘top
hats’
or
cabins
are
modular
and
purpose-built
to
provide
tailored
solutions
for
our
customers.
The
remaining
layers
include
connected\naccessories
and
a
digital
customer
ecosystem
that
present
high-margin
opportunities
that
extend
through
the
lifecycle
of
the
vehicle
across
multiple
owners.
Our
software
solutions\nprovide
us
with
monetizable
opportunities
throughout
the
vehicle
life,
including
predictive
maintenance
and
service
or
advanced
driver
assistance
systems
(“ADAS”)
upgrades.\nOur
platform
architecture
is
a
self-contained,
fully
functional
rolling
chassis
that
directly
houses
the
most
critical
components
for
operation
of
an
EV,
including
our
in-\nhouse
designed
proprietary
electric
drivetrain,
battery
systems,
advanced
vehicle
control
electronics
and
software
and
other
critical
components,
which
all
have
been
optimized
for\nfunctional
integration.
Both
our
true
steer-by-wire
system,
believed
to
be
the
first
such
system
applied
to
a
production
intent
vehicle,
and
our
transverse
composite
leaf-spring\nsuspension
system
are
core
components
of
our
platform’s
differentiated
functionality,
enabling
the
development
of
a
broad
range
of
vehicle
types
and
use
cases
due
to
the
chassis’\nflat
profile
and
fully
variable
steering
positions.
All
of
our
announced
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle,
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle,
the
MPDV
and
the
Pickup,
will\nshare
a
common
platform
architecture
paired
with
different
‘top
hats’
to
create
a
range
of
unique
purpose-built
mobility
solutions.\nIn
addition
to
our
vehicle
technology,
we
are
developing
an
in-house
designed
and
proprietary
software
platform
that
aggregates
car
data
from
both
Canoo
and
non-Canoo\nvehicles
and
delivers
valuable
insights
to
our
customers.
Collected
over-the-air
for
connected
vehicles
or
via
an
on-board
diagnostics
(“OBD”)
device
for
non-connected
vehicles,\nwe
believe
car
data
is
critical
to
empowering
the
customer
journey
and
maximizing
utility
and
value
from
the
vehicle
ownership
experience.
Leveraging
our
data
aggregation\nplatform,
we
aim
to
create
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
an
application
store
that
centralizes
all
vehicle
information
for
customers
and
provides
key
tools
across
Security
&
Safety,\n36\n"",

Through
our
software
offering,
we
believe
we
can
provide\ndifferentiated
and
substantial
value
to
customers
while
creating
revenue
opportunities
throughout
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.\nCore
to
our
values
is
delivering
high
quality
products
while
empowering
local
communities,
which
drove
our
decision
to
build
in
America
and
source
a
majority
of
our\nparts
from
America
and
allied
nations.
We
believe
vertical
integration
across
our
manufacturing
and
assembly
process
will
enable
us
to
achieve
in-house
scale
production
with
less\nsupply
chain
risk
and
provide
us
with
better
oversight
of
our
vehicle
manufacturing.
We
are
building
production
facilities
in
states
and
communities
that
are
investing
in
high-tech\nmanufacturing
alongside
us,
creating
American
jobs
and
driving
innovation.\nRecent
Developments\nRefer

for

regarding
subsequent
events.\nKey
Factors
Affecting
Operating
Results\nWe
believe
that
our
performance
and
future
success
depend
on
several
factors
that
present
significant
opportunities
for
us
but
also
pose
risks
and
challenges,
including\nthose
discussed
below.\nAvailability
of
Financing
Sources
and
Commercialization
of
Our
EVs\nWe
expect
to
derive
future
revenue
from
our
first
vehicle
offerings.
In
order
to
reach
commercialization,
we
must
purchase
and
integrate
related
property
and
equipment,\nas
well
as
achieve
several
research
and
development
milestones.\nOur
capital
and
operating
expenditures
have
increased
significantly
in
connection
with
our
ongoing
activities
and
we
expect
they
will
continue
to
increase,
as
we:\n•\ncontinue
to
invest
in
our
technology,
research
and
development
efforts;\n•\ncompensate
existing
personnel;\n•\ninvest
in
manufacturing
capacity,
via
our
owned
facilities;\n•\nincrease
our
investment
in
marketing,
advertising,
sales
and
distribution
infrastructure
for
our
EVs
and
services;\n•\nobtain,
maintain
and
improve
our
operational,
financial
and
management
information
systems;\n•\nhire
additional
personnel;\n•\ncommercialize
our
EVs;\n•\nobtain,
maintain,
expand
and
protect
our
intellectual
property
portfolio;
and\n•\ncontinue
to
operate
as
a
public
company.\nWe
require
substantial
additional
capital
to
develop
our
EVs
and
services
and
fund
our
operations
for
the
foreseeable
future.
We
will
also
require
capital
to
identify
and\ncommit
resources
to
investigate
new
areas
of
demand.
Until
we
can
generate
sufficient
revenue
from
vehicle
sales,
we
are
financing
our
operations
through
access
to
private
and\npublic
equity
offerings
and
debt
financings.
Management
believes
substantial
doubt
exists
about
the
Company’s
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern
for
twelve
months
from
the\ndate
of
issuance
of
the
financial
statements
included
in

Report
on

Conditions\nCurrent
adverse
macroeconomic
conditions,
including
but
not
limited
to
heightened
inflation,
slower
growth
or
recession,
changes
to
fiscal
and
monetary
policy,
higher\ninterest

currency
fluctuations
and
challenges
in

could
negatively
affect

demand
for
semiconductor
chips
in
2020,
due
in
part
to
increased
demand
for
consumer
electronics
that
use
these
chips,
resulted
in
a
global
shortage
of
chips
in\n2021
that
has
continued
into
2023.
As
a
result,
our
ability
to
source
semiconductor
chips
used
in
our
vehicles
may
be
adversely
affected.
This
shortage
may
result
in
increased
chip\ndelivery
lead
times,
delays
in
the
production
of
our
vehicles,
and
increased
costs
to
source
available
semiconductor
chips.\nAlthough
we
have
made
our
best
estimates
based
upon
current
information,
actual
results
could
materially
differ
from
the
estimates
and
assumptions
developed
by\nmanagement.
Accordingly,
it
is
reasonably
possible
that
the
estimates
made
in
the
financial
statements
have
been,
or
will
be,
materially
and
adversely
impacted
in
the
near
term
as
a\nresult
of
these
conditions,
and
if
so,
we
may
be
subject
to
future
impairment
losses
related
to
long-lived
assets
as
well
as
changes
to
valuations.\nKey

and
Cost
of
Revenues\nRevenues
include

vehicles
to
our
customers
as
well
as
revenues
derived
from
other
streams
including
battery
modules,\nand
engineering
services
to
our
customers.
We
generated
$0.5
million
in
revenues
during
the
three
and
nine
months
ended
September
30,
2023.
We
expect
to
ramp
volumes
over
the\nrest
of
2023
and
2024
at
a
measured
pace
to
match
with
the
delivery
schedules
that
are
being
agreed
with
our
customers.
Our
cost
of
revenues
primarily
include
vehicle
components\nand
parts,
labor
costs,
and
amortized
tooling
and
capitalized
costs
involved
in

includes
LCNRV
write
down
of
$0.4
million
during
the
three
and
nine
months
ended
September
30,
2023.\nAs
our
cost
of

were
greater
than

it
resulted
in
a
negative
gross
margin
of
$0.4
million
during
the
three
and
nine
months
ended
September
30,
2023.\nNegative
gross
margin
was
primarily
due
to
the
custom-built,
low-volume
initial
vehicle
deliveries.
We
expect
negative
gross
margin
to
improve
on
a
per-vehicle
basis
as
we\nincrease
overall
production
levels,
and
achieve
commercial
cost
savings
on
material
and
labor
costs.\nResearch

Development
Expenses,

30,
2023,
compared
to
$57.1
million
in
the\nthree
months
ended

The

was
primarily
due

are
intended
as
a
supplemental

of

We
believe
EBITDA,
Adjusted

when
combined
with

are

of

We
believe
that
the
use
of

provides
an\nadditional
tool
for
investors
to
use
in

and
in
comparing
our
financial
measures
with
those
of
comparable
companies,
which
may\npresent
similar

to

However,
you
should
be
aware
that
when
evaluating
EBITDA,
Adjusted
EBITDA,
Adjusted
Net
Loss,
and
Adjusted\nEPS
we
may
incur
future
expenses
similar
to
those
excluded
when
calculating
these
measures.
In
addition,
our
presentation
of
these
measures
should
not
be
construed
as
an\ninference
that
our
future
results
will
be
unaffected
by
unusual
or
non-recurring
items.
Our
computation
of
EBITDA,
Adjusted
EBITDA,
Adjusted
Net
Loss,
and
Adjusted
EPS
may\nnot
be
comparable
to
other
similarly
titled

computed
by

because
all
companies
may
not
calculate
EBITDA,
Adjusted

and\nAdjusted

in
the
same
fashion.\nBecause
of
these
limitations,
EBITDA,
Adjusted

and

should
not
be
considered
in

or
as

We
manage
our

utilizing

\nLiquidity
and
Capital
Resources\nAs
of
September
30,
2023,
we
had
unrestricted
cash
and
cash
equivalents
in
the
amount
of
$8.3
million,
which
were
primarily
invested
in
money
market
funds
that
consist\nof
liquid
debt
securities
issued
by
the
U.S.
government.
In
assessing
our
liquidity
requirements
and
cash
needs,
we
also
consider
contractual
obligations
to
which
we
are
a
party.\nAdditionally,
see
discussion
related
to
the
operating
lease
maturity
schedule
and
any
new
leases
entered
into
in
Note
10
of
the
notes
to
our
accompanying
financial
statements.\nWe
have
incurred
and
expect
to
incur,
net
losses
which
have
resulted
in
an
accumulated
deficit
of
$1.5
billion
as
of
September
30,
2023.
Management
continues
to
explore\nraising
additional
capital
through
a
combination
of
debt
financing,
other
non-dilutive
financing
and/or
equity
financing
to
supplement
the
Company’s
capitalization
and
liquidity.
If\nand
as
we
raise
additional
funds
by
incurring
loans
or
by
issuing
debt
securities
or
preferred
stock,
these
forms
of
financing
have
rights,
preferences,
and
privileges
senior
to
those\nof
holders
of
our
Common
Stock.
The
availability
and
the
terms
under
which
we
are
able
to
raise
additional
capital
could
be
disadvantageous,
and
the
terms
of
debt
financing
or\nother
non-dilutive
financing
involve
restrictive
covenants
and
dilutive
financing
instruments,
which
could
place
significant
restrictions
on
our
operations.
Macroeconomic\nconditions
and
credit
markets
are
also
impacting
the
availability
and
cost
of
potential
future
debt
financing.
As
we
raise
capital
through
the
issuance
of
additional
equity,
such
sales\nand
issuance
has
and
will
continue
to
dilute
the
ownership
interests
of
the
existing
holders
of
Common
Stock.
There
can
be
no
assurances
that
any
additional
debt,
other
non-\ndilutive
and/or
equity
financing
would
be
available
to
us
on
favorable
terms
or
at
all.
We
expect
to
continue
to
incur
net
losses,
comprehensive
losses,
and
negative
cash
flows
from\noperating
activities
in
accordance
with
our
operating
plan
as
we
continue
to
expand
our
research
and
development
activities
to
complete
the
development
of
our
EVs,
establish
our\ngo-to-market
model
and
scale
our
operations
to
meet
anticipated
demand.

Accounting
Estimates\nOur
condensed
consolidated
financial
statements
(unaudited)
have
been
prepared
in
accordance
with
GAAP.
The
preparation
of
these
financial
statements
requires
us
to\nmake
estimates
and
assumptions
that
affect
the
reported
amounts
of
assets
and
liabilities
and
the
disclosure
of
contingent
assets
and
liabilities
as
of
the
date
of
the
financial\nstatements,
as
well
as
the
reported
expenses
incurred
during
the
reporting
periods.
Our
estimates
are
based
on
our
historical
experience
and
on
various
other
factors
that
we
believe\nare
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
the
results
of
which
form
the
basis
for
making
judgments
about
the
carrying
value
of
assets
and
liabilities
that
are
not
readily
apparent
from\nother
sources.Actual
results
may
differ
from
these
estimates
under
different
assumptions
or
conditions.
We
believe
that
the
accounting
policies
discussed
below
are
critical
to\nunderstanding
our
historical
and
future
performance,
as
these
policies
relate
to
the
more
significant
areas
involving
management’s
judgments
and
estimates.\nConvertible
Debentures\nThe
Company
elected
the
fair
value
option
to
account
for
the
Convertible
Debentures
in
an
aggregate
principal
amount
of
up
to
$62.5

of
the
Notes
to
our
unaudited
condensed
consolidated
financial
statements
included
elsewhere
in
this\nQuarterly
Report
on
Form
10-Q.
The
Convertible
Debentures
are
measured
at
fair
value
on
a
recurring
basis
using
Level

inputs.
We
use
the
Monte

technique
to\nmeasure
the
fair
value
of
the
Convertible
Debentures
with
any
changes
in
the

with
the

Quantitative
and
Qualitative
Disclosures
About
Market
Risk\nWe
have
not,
to
date,
been
exposed
to
material
market
risks
given
our
early
stage
of
operations.
Upon
commencing
commercial
operations,
we
may
be
exposed
to
material\nmarket
risks.
Market
risk
represents
the
risk
of
loss
that
may
impact
our
financial
position
due
to
adverse
changes
in
financial
market
prices
and
rates.
Our
current
market
risk\nexposure
is
primarily
the
result
of
fluctuations
in
interest
rates.
\nInterest
Rate
Risk\nWe
are
exposed
to
market
risk
for
changes
in
interest
rates
applicable
to
our
cash
and
cash
equivalents.
We
had
cash
and
cash
equivalents
totaling
$8.3
million
as
of\nSeptember
30,
2023.
Our
cash
and
cash
equivalents
were
invested
primarily
in
money
market
funds
and
are
not
invested
for
trading
or
speculative
purposes.
However,
due
to
the\nshort-term
nature
and
the
low-risk
profile
of
the
money
market
funds,
we
do
not
believe
a
sudden
increase
or
decrease
in
market
interest
rates
would
have
a
material
effect
on
the\nfair
market
value
of
our
portfolio.

Controls
and
Procedures\nEvaluation
of
Disclosure
Controls
and
Procedures\nOur
management,
with
the
participation
of
our
Executive
Chair
and
CEO
and
Chief
Financial
Officer
(""CFO""),
has
evaluated
the
effectiveness
of
our
disclosure
controls\nand
procedures
as
of
September
30,
2023.
We
have
established
and
currently
maintain
disclosure
controls
and
procedures,
as
such
term
is
defined
in
Rules
13a-15(e)
and
15d-15(e)\nof
the
Exchange
Act,
designed
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
information
required
to
be
disclosed
in
our
reports
filed
under
the
Exchange
Act,
is
recorded,
processed,\nsummarized
and
reported
within
the
time
periods
specified
in
the
SEC\'s
rules
and
forms,
and
that
such
information
is
accumulated
and
communicated
to
management,
including
our\nprincipal
executive
officer
and
principal
financial
officer,
as
appropriate,
to
allow
for
timely
decisions
regarding
required
disclosure.
In
designing
and
evaluating
disclosure
controls\nand
procedures,
management
recognized
that
any
controls
and
procedures,
no
matter
how
well
designed
and
operated,
can
provide
only
reasonable
assurance
of
achieving
the\ndesired
control
objectives,
and
management
necessarily
was
required
to
apply
its
judgment
in
evaluating
the
cost-benefit
relationship
of
possible
controls
and
procedures.\nBased
on
an
evaluation
of
our
disclosure
controls
and
procedures,
our
CEO
and
CFO
concluded
that
our
disclosure
controls
and
procedures
were
effective
at
a
reasonable\nassurance
level
as
of
September
30,
2023.\nChanges
in
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting\nThere
were
no
changes
in
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
(as
that
term
is
defined
in
Rules
13a-15(f)
and
15d-15(f)
under
the
Exchange
Act)
during
the

likely
to

BUSINESS\nCompany
Overview\nCanoo
is
a
mobility
technology
company
with
a
mission
to
bring
electric
vehicles
(“EVs”)
to
everyone
and
provide
connected
services
that
improve
the
vehicle
ownership\nexperience.
We
are
developing
a
technology
platform
that
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
rapidly
innovate
and
bring
new
products,
addressing
multiple
use
cases,
to
market
faster
than\nour
competition
and
at
lower
cost.
Our
vehicle
architecture
and
design
philosophy
are
aimed
at
driving
productivity
and
returning
capital
to
our
customers,
and
we
believe
the\nsoftware
and
technology
capabilities
we
are
developing,
packaged
around
a
modular,
customizable
product,
have
the
potential
to
fundamentally
alter
the
value
proposition
across
a\nvehicle’s
lifecycle.
We
remain
committed
to
the
environment
and
to
delivering
sustainable
mobility
that
is
accessible
to
everyone.
We
proudly
intend
to
manufacture
our
fully\nelectric
vehicles
in
Arkansas
and
Oklahoma,
bringing
advanced
manufacturing
and
technology
jobs
to
communities
in
America's
heartland.
We
are
committed
to
building
a
diverse\nworkforce
that
will
draw
heavily
upon
the
local
communities
of
Native
Americans
and
veterans.\nWe
believe
we
are
one
of
the
first
automotive
manufacturers
focused
on
capturing
value
across
the
entirety
of
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.
Our
platform\nand
data
architecture
is
purpose-built
to
be
durable
and
serve
as
the
foundation
for
the
vehicles
we
intend
to
offer,
unlocking
a
highly
differentiated,
multi-layer
business
model.
The\nfoundational
layer
is
our
Multi-Purpose
Platform
(“MPP”
or
“platform”)
architecture,
which
serves
as
the
base
of
our
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
its
Delivery,\nBase,
Premium,
and
Adventure
trims;
the
Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicle
(“MPDV”)
and
the
Pickup.
The
next
layer
is
cybersecurity
which
is
embedded
in
our
vehicle
to
ensure\nthe
privacy
and
protection
of
vehicle
data.
Our
top
hats,
or
cabins,
are
modular
and
purpose-built
to
provide
tailored
solutions
for
our
customers.
This
intentional
design
enables
us\nto
efficiently
use
resources
to
produce
only
what
is
necessary,
underscoring
our
focus
on
sustainability
and
returning
capital
to
customers.
The
remaining
layers,
connected\naccessories
and
digital
customer
ecosystem,
present
high-margin
opportunities
that
extend
beyond
the
initial
vehicle
sale,
across
multiple
owners.
Owners
will
further
be
able
to\ncustomize
their
vehicles
by
adding
connected
accessories
such
as
Bluetooth
devices

In
addition,
there
are
opportunities
for
software
sales
throughout
the\nvehicle
life,
including
predictive
maintenance
and
service
software
or
advanced
driver

systems
(“ADAS”)
upgrades.\nOur
platform
architecture
is
a
self-contained,
fully
functional
rolling
chassis
that
directly
houses
the
most
critical
components
for
operation
of
an
EV,
including
our
in-\nhouse
designed
proprietary
electric
drivetrain,
battery
systems,
advanced
vehicle
control
electronics
and
software
and
other
critical
components,
which
all
have
been
optimized
for\nfunctional
integration.
Both
our
true
steer-by-wire
system,
believed
to
be
the
first
such
system
applied
to
a
production-intent
vehicle,
and
our
flat
composite
leaf-spring

are
core
components
of
our
platform’s
differentiated
functionality,
enabling
the
development
of
a
broad
range
of
vehicle
types
and
use
cases
due
to
the
chassis’
flat
profile\nand
fully
variable
steering
positions.
All
of
our
announced
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle,
the
MPDV
and
the
Pickup,
will
share
a\ncommon
platform
architecture
paired
with
different
top

to
create
a
range
of
uniquely
customized
and
use
case
optimized
purpose-built
mobility
solutions
targeting
multiple\nsegments
of
the
rapidly
expanding
EV
marketplace.\nIn
addition
to
our
vehicle
technology,
we
are
developing
a
software
platform
that
aggregates
car
data
from
both
Canoo
and
non-Canoo
vehicles
and
delivers
valuable\ninsights
to
our
customers.
Collected
over-the-air
for
connected
vehicles
or
via
an
on-board
diagnostics
(“OBD”)
device
for
non-connected
vehicles,
we
believe
car
data
is
critical
to\npowering
the
customer
journey
and
maximizing
utility
and
value
from
the
vehicle
ownership
experience.
Leveraging
our
data
aggregation
platform,
we
aim
to
create
the
Canoo\nDigital
Ecosystem,
an
application
store
that
centralizes
all
vehicle
information
for
customers
and
provides
key
tools
across
Security
&
Safety,
Household
Management,
Fleet\nManagement,
Lifecycle
Management
and
Vehicle
Asset
Management.
Through
our
software
offering,
we
believe
we
can
provide
differentiated
value
to
both
commercial
customers\nand
consumers
by
staying
connected
throughout
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.\nCore
to
our
ethos
is
delivering
high
quality
products
while
empowering
local
communities,
which
drove
our
decision
to
build
in
America
and
source
a
majority
of
our\nparts
from
America
and
allied
nations.
We
believe
vertical
integration
across
our
manufacturing
and
assembly
process
will
enable
us
to
achieve
start
of
production
(“SOP”)
with\nless
supply
chain
risk
and
provide
us
better
oversight
of
our
vehicle
manufacturing.
We
are
building
production
facilities
in
states
and
communities
that
are
investing
in
high-tech\nmanufacturing
alongside
us,
creating
American
jobs
and
driving
innovation.
We
intend
to
have
an
advanced

test
and
validate
our
manufacturing
equipment
and
processes
before
large-scale
production
begins
in
our
mega
microfactory.
In
the
long
term,
we
expect
to
use
the
Bentonville\nfacility
for
rapidly
innovating
on
product
concepts.\nWe
have
made
strategic
investments
in
our
technology
and
products
that
position
us
to
capture
three
large
and
growing
markets
-
commercial
and
passenger
vehicles,\nupfitting
and
accessories,
and
car
data.
With
the
rise
of
on-demand
delivery
and
eCommerce,
it
is
increasingly
important
to
bring
electrification
to
commercial
vehicles,
which\nMordor
Intelligence
estimated
represented
a
market
opportunity
of
over
$715
billion
as
of
2020.
We
also
have
chosen
to
pursue
the
most
profitable
segments
of
the
passenger\nvehicle
market,
the
SUV
and
Pickup
segments,
which
IHS
estimates
to
have
generated
over
$115
billion
in
profits
in
2020.
In
addition
to
this
opportunity
in
commercial
and\npassenger
vehicle
markets,
due
to
the
modularity
and
customization
of
all
our
vehicles,
we
believe
there
is
a
significant
opportunity
in
upfitting
and
accessories
across
the
vehicle\nlifecycle,
which
the
Specialty
Equipment
Market
Association
(“SEMA”)
estimated
were
valued
at
$24
billion
in
2020.
Lastly,
according
to
research
conducted
by
McKinsey,
the\nvalue
from
car
data
monetization
is
expected
to
generate
an
over
$250
billion
market
by
2030.
Altogether,
we
estimate
our
highly
strategic
total
market
opportunity
could
grow
to\nbe
over
$1
trillion.\nSince
our
founding
in
2017,
we
continue
to
innovate
on
our
technology
and
strategy.
To
date,
we
have
achieved
critical
milestones
in
the
development,
testing,
and\nmanufacturing
of
our

We
continue
to
innovate
and
develop
every
aspect
of
our
business,
from
our
non-traditional
business
model
to
our
built
in
America,
highly
utilitarian
vehicles
optimized
to
return\ncapital
to
our
customers.
We
believe
being
forward-thinking
across
these
areas
has
set
the
foundation
for
us
to
develop
into
a
scalable
business
that
is
differentiated
from
our
peers\nacross
the
automotive
original
equipment
manufacturer
(“OEM”)
landscape.\nOur
Foundational
Chassis
and
Purpose-Built
Vehicles\nOur
Multi-Purpose
Platform\nWe
have
designed
what
we
believe
to
be
the
world’s
most
modular,
flattest,
production-ready
EV
platform,
purposefully
engineered
to
provide
maximum
consumer
and\ncargo
space
on
a
small
vehicle
footprint.
The
platform’s
modularity
supports
a
wide
range
of
vehicle
applications
and
use
cases.
With
a
common
platform
architecture,
we
expect
to\nenable
the
production
of
our
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle,
MPDV,
and
Pickup,
among
other
additional
vehicle
variants.
By
using
a
uniquely
versatile
platform\narchitecture
strategy
as
the
foundation
for
multiple
vehicles,
we
expect
to
reduce
both
time
and
expense
in
research
and
development,
testing
and
manufacturing,
enabling
us
to\ndevelop
and
scale
future
vehicle
programs
faster
and
at
a
significantly
lower
overall
cost
than
other
vehicle
manufacturers.
In
addition,
by
allowing
us
to
much
more
rapidly

up
to
300
miles,
and
has
a
significant
portion
of
the
vehicle’s
overall
crash
structure
integrated
into
the
design.
The
platform
was

and
is
designed
to
be
manufactured
on
an
entirely
independent
basis
or
in
parallel
with
a
vehicle
top
hat,
a
considerable
innovation
in
design
that
reduces
complexity
in\nassembly
and
will
facilitate
more
efficient
production
at
scale.\n
Our
proprietary
platform
architecture
directly
houses
all
of
the
most
critical
components
of
an
EV,
including
the
market’s
first
true
steer-by-wire
platform,
a
composite
leaf\nspring
suspension
system,
an
advanced
fully
electric
drivetrain,
a
modular
battery
and
battery
management
systems,
“DC
fast
charge”
and
bi-directional
charging
capabilities,
and\nan
innovative
electrical
systems
architecture.
Each
of
these
component
systems
has
been
engineered
not
only
for
optimal
performance
but
also
for
efficient
packaging
into
our\ncompact
platform,
with
a
strong
emphasis
given
to
functional
integration,
meaning
that
all
components
fulfill
as
many
functions
as
possible.
This
strategy
reduces
the
total
number\nof
parts
and
platform
size
and
weight,
ultimately
providing
a
more
spacious,
utilitarian
interior
and
cost-effective
EV
offering.\nTrue
Steer-by-Wire\nOur
platform
will
allow
for
the
first
true
steer-by-wire
vehicles
on
the
market,
eliminating
the
need
for
mechanical
connections
between
the
steering
wheel
and
the
steering\nrack.
Steering,
braking,
and
acceleration
of
the
vehicle
will
be
performed
entirely
through
electrical
signals,
and
our
system
has
been
designed
to
be
fully
redundant
in
hardware\nand
software,
ensuring
continuous
safe
operation.
By
introducing
steer-by-wire,
we
are
able
to
adjust
the
placement
of
the
steering
wheel
to
suit
any
cabin
design
and
driver\npositioning,
offering
greater
design
freedom
and
modularity
across
all
our
vehicles.\nOur
advanced
steer-by-wire
system
offers
a
number
of
significant
advantages
in
vehicle
design,
engineering
and
safety.
Our
system
enables
us
to
design
vehicles
with
a\nhigh
degree
of
flexibility.
For
example,
steer-by-wire
allows
for
easily
integrating
right-hand
drive
in
applicable
jurisdictions
or
positioning
the
driver
further
forward
to
allow
for
a\nmore
spacious
vehicle
interior
on
a
comparatively
small
footprint,
ideal
for
commercial
deliveries
in
urban
markets.
Further,
our
proprietary
architecture
with
the
secure,
redundant\ncommunication
framework
is
essential
for
our
longer-term
vehicle
strategy.\nLeaf
Spring
Suspension
System\nOur
platform
incorporates
a
variable
leaf
spring
suspension
system
offering
advantages
both
in
terms
of
vehicle
design
and
modularity.
Most
EVs
on
the
road
today\ncontinue
to
employ
large
conventional
strut
towers,
coil
springs
and
dampeners
—
a
legacy
of
internal
combustion
engine
design.
These
intrude
into
the
cabin
and
effectively\nconstrict
the
vehicle’s
useable
passenger
space
to
the
limited
area
between
the
front
and
rear
suspension
towers.
By
contrast,
our
platform
incorporates
two
composite
fiberglass
leaf\nsprings,
mounted
transversally
in
the
front
and
rear
of
the
platform.
With
the
aid
of
other
compact
suspension
components,
our
leaf
spring
suspension
allows
the
entire
suspension\npackage
to
sit
below
the
height
of
the
tires.
These
design
advantages
create
an
overall
flat
platform
architecture,
maximizing
usable
interior
space
in
the
cabin
while
continuing
to\nprovide
optimal
ride
and
roll
support.
The
flat
suspension
allows
for
approximately
30%
to
40%
more
interior
space
compared
to
a
traditional
passenger
vehicle
architecture
of
the\nsame
length.
It
also
reduces
the
number
of
suspension
parts
needed
in
the
platform,
thereby
reducing
component
cost
and
mass.
Importantly,
our
proprietary
suspension
system
is\nalso
designed
to
be
easily
tunable
to
support
a
diverse
range
of
additional
vehicle
weight
and
ride
profiles.
This
modularity
is
critical
to
enabling
the
platform
to
perform
optimally\nfor
multiple
vehicle
types.\n7\n',

We
developed
all
of
our
powertrain

in-house
and
believe
we\nhave
made
several
important
advancements.
Our
drive
unit
utilizes
a
proprietary
permanent
magnet

developed
to
provide
the
highest
efficiency
throughout
the
vehicle.
Our\nproprietary
design
has
reduced
our
drive

simplifying
sourcing
and
minimizing
cost.
Our
drive
units
are
integral
to
our
modular
platform
development
strategy.\nBattery
and
Battery
Management
Systems\nMultiple
proprietary
battery
technologies
are
incorporated
into
our
platform,
including
a
distinctive
battery
module
architecture,
in-house
developed
battery
modules\noptimized
for
low
cost
and
high
energy
density,
thermal
management
technology,
and
battery
management
systems.
We
believe
a
core
distinguishing
feature
of
our
platform
design\nis
the
elimination
of
a
separate
battery
enclosure
which
is
found
in
nearly
all
competitor
vehicles.
Rather
than
placing
our
battery
modules
into
an
enclosure
that
is
then
sealed
and\nplaced
into
the
underbody,
our
battery
modules
are
packaged
directly
inside
the
platform
structure
protected
by
a
high-strength
steel
structure
and
innovative
crash
features.
The\nbattery
placement
allows
for
easy
service
at
the
battery
cell
level
and
provides
a
number
of
critical
advantages,
including
cost
optimization,
space
savings,
and
significant
reductions\nin
mass.\nThe
design
of
our
battery
systems
has
focused
on
reducing
the
cost
per
unit
of
energy
stored
to
a
targeted
best-in-class
value,
while
maintaining
performance,
safety,\nreliability,
durability
and
longevity.
This
is
achieved
through
the
use
of
high
energy
density,
low
cost
commoditized
cylindrical
cells,
high
manufacturing
throughput
and
capital\nefficient
assembly
process,
as
well
as
the
avoidance
of
exotic
materials
and
processes.
Thermal
management
of
the
battery
cells
and
modules
is
critical
and
we
have
developed
a\nproprietary
liquid-cooled
battery
thermal
management
system
that
provides
a
very
low
thermal
impedance
between
the
battery
cells
and
the
coolant,
allowing
very
high
continuous\npower
in
both
charge
and
discharge
modes
of
operation.
Our
in-house
developed
proprietary
battery
management
system
incorporates
voltage,
temperature
and
current
monitoring\nfunctions
to
monitor
battery
condition
real
time,
gathering
information
for
trend
analysis.\nAfter
substantial
testing,
we
reached
an
agreement
with
Panasonic
to
supply
batteries
for
our
Lifestyle
Vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
Lifestyle
Delivery\nVehicle.
Panasonic
is
a
world-class
manufacturer,
with
billions
of
cells
on
the
road,
of
what
we
believe
are
one
of
the
safest,
most
durable
electric
vehicle
batteries.\nCharging
Capabilities\nOur
battery
pack
supports
“DC
fast
charge”
(and
supports
high
discharge
power
both
in
peak
and
continuous
operation).
We
can
use
the
standard
CCS
(North\nAmerica/Europe)
and
GB/T
(China)
charging
protocols
and
can
easily
adapt
our
charging
system
to
existing
commercial
operator
network.
An
80

battery
pack,
standard
on\nour
Lifestyle
Vehicles,
will
be
able
to

offers
a
spacious

with
more
than\n35%
lower
total
cost
of
ownership
than
peer
vehicles,
according
to
our
estimates.
The
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle
will
showcase
a
200-plus
mile
range,
1,500-pound
payload,
and\nspacious
cargo
volume
on
a
compact

and
individuals
within
the
rapidly

By
capitalizing
on
EV
architecture,
our
Lifestyle

eliminates
compartmentalization
and
manifests
an
impression
of
“an
urban
loft
on

more
interior
volume
than
a
SUV
and
an
exterior
footprint
comparable
to
a
VW
Golf,
the
Lifestyle

accommodates
space
for
up
to
seven

Preliminary\nspecifications
for
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
include
a
targeted
250

in
mind,
the
vehicle
was
customized
to
maximize

gains
with
high
roof
heights,
storage
lockers,
and
slide-out
ramps.
For
business
owners,
through
its

our
MPDV
will
function
as
a
mobile
power

Opportunity\nOur
diverse
vehicle
offering
and
digital
ecosystem
are
positioned
to
address
a
significant
opportunity
for
both
passenger
and
commercial
applications.
The
demand
for
EVs\nis
increasing
quickly
among
both
passenger
and
commercial
markets.
In
the
passenger
EV
market
in
the
United
States,
demand
is
expected
to
grow
at
a
26%
CAGR
from
2019
to\n2028,
according
to
EVAdoption,
with
particularly
high
rates
of
growth
anticipated
within
urban
areas.
Regulatory
tailwinds
in
the
United
States
including
proposed
fuel
economy\nrules
and
the
Infrastructure
Investment
and
Jobs
Act
are
expected
to
drive
EV
demand.
With
the
significant
expansion
of
EV
charging
stations,
especially
in
rural
disadvantaged
and\nhard
to
reach
areas,
easier
access
to
charging
stations
will
only
further
increase
EV
adoption.
As
companies
are
increasingly
pressured
by
both
regulators,
customers,
and\nenvironmental,
social
and
governance
stakeholders
to
reduce
their
carbon
footprint,
the
adoption
of
EVs
among
businesses,
including
commercial
delivery
vehicles,
is
also
expected\nto
see
a
dramatic
increase,
and
this
shift
is
projected
to
be
led
by
the
light
commercial
vehicle
segment.
The
demand
for
EV
light
commercial
vehicles
in
the
United
States,
Europe\nand
China
is
expected
to
grow
at
a
33%
CAGR
from
2019
to
2028,
according
to
Navigant
Research.\nCompelling
Commercial
EV
Opportunity\nWe
believe
this
last
mile
delivery
segment
represents
an
untapped
market
with
strong
demand
for
an
attractive,
flexible
EV
option.
According
to
eMarketer,
the
North\nAmerican
e-commerce
market
is
projected
to
grow
at
a
18.4%
CAGR
(between
2019
and
2025),
reaching
approximately
$1.6
trillion
in
scale
by
2025.
Further,
the
transition
of\nexisting
and
new
last
mile
delivery
fleets
to
all
EVs
is
expected
to
be
a
significant
trend
in
the
short-term
period,
according
to
McKinsey.
According
to
Bloomberg
NEF,
light
duty\ncommercial
vehicles,
such
as
last
mile
delivery
vehicles,
will
be
the
first
commercial
vehicles
to
transition
to
electric,
as
compared
to
medium
and
heavy
duty
commercial
vehicles.\nWe
believe
we
are
well-positioned
to
capitalize
on
these
macro
tailwinds
and
market
needs
through
an
all-electric
solution
that
offers
maximized
cargo
volume
in
an\nefficient,
urban-friendly
footprint.
We
developed
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle
to
capture
this
commercial
demand.
In
addition,
we
expect
that
our
MPDV
vehicle
will
allow
us
to\ncapture
greater
market
share
in
the
future.
We
believe
we
have
three
distinct
competitive
advantages.
First,
our
battery
module
configuration,
together
with
our
proprietary\npowertrain
system,
enable
superior
range
efficiency.
Second,

which
is
a
necessity
for
driving

market
and
a
key
determinant
of
a
vehicle’s
residual
value.\nExpected
Highly
Attractive
Passenger
EV
Market
in
the
United
States\nAccording
to
Bloomberg
NEF,
global
sales
of
new
passenger
EVs
are
expected
to
grow
from
2.7%
of
total
vehicle
sales
in
2020
to
10%
and
58%,
in
2025
and
2040,\nrespectively.
Consumers,
facing
the
growing
threat
of
climate
change
and
becoming
more
confident
in
improved
EV
range
and
the
broader
expansion
of
EV
charging\ninfrastructures,
are
increasingly
looking
to
an
EV
as
their
next
vehicle.
Consumers
in
urban
areas,
in
particular,
have
shown
the
highest
levels
of
demand.\nDemand
for
passenger
EVs
in
the
United
States,
specifically,
is
expected
to
grow
quickly
at
a
26%
CAGR
from
2019
to
2028
and
reach
over
3
million
EVs
on
the
road
by\n2028,
according
to
EVAdoption.
Potential
significant
upside
in
the
consumer
EV
segment
remains
as
the
penetration
of
EVs
in
the
United
States
as
a
percentage
of
total
annual\nconsumer
vehicle
sales
is
expected
to
still
be
under
3%
in
2022,
according
to
data
from
Bloomberg
NEF,
presenting
substantial
growth
potential
for
our
consumer
vehicle
offerings.\nThe
scalable
design
and
modularity
of
our
platform
reinforces
the
ability
to
introduce
a
variety
of
consumer
focused
vehicle
cabin
configurations
at
lower
development\ncosts
while
accelerating
our
go-to-market
timing.
We
believe
that
our
initial
and
future
consumer
vehicles,
built
on
top
of
our
platform,
present
a
strong
opportunity
to
capitalize
on\nsignificant
demand
for
consumer
EVs.
The
addressable
upfitting
and

with
emphasis
on
the

generate
an
exponential

effect
as
each
Canoo

With
over
$250
billion
of
estimated
value
from

globally,
we
believe
that
our
differentiated

gives
us
a
distinct
advantage.
We\nestimate
that
there
is
1
-
2
terabytes
of
raw
data
produced
per

In
addition,
we
estimate
that
95%
of

to
50%
today.
We
believe
we
can
monetize
data
and
provide

to
our
customers
for
their
legacy
and
Canoo
vehicles.
Our
digital
ecosystem
will
act
as
a
central\n“application
store”
for
vehicle
owners.
We
believe
our
digital
ecosystem
is
a
differentiator
compared
to
competitors
given
our
deep
expertise
in
developing
vehicle
lifecycle\ntechnology.\nCompetitive
Strengths\nWe
believe
our
intentional
strategy
to
focus
on
the
entirety
of
the
vehicle
lifecycle
provides
distinct
advantages
that
position
us
to
win:\n•\nNon-traditional
business
model
drives
revenue
throughout
the
vehicle
lifecycle:
Today,
OEMs
are
primarily
focused
on
selling
vehicles
to
their
first
owner,
leaving\nsignificant
opportunity
behind
in
the
aftermarket.
We
estimate
there
are
50-70
monetizable
touchpoints
across
a
vehicle’s
entire
lifetime,
such
as
car
part
replacements,\nservice
and
maintenance.
These
incremental
opportunities
come
from
our
durable
MPP,
adaptable
top
hats,
customizable
connected
accessories,
automotive
service-related\nsoftware
offerings
and
over-the-air
upgrades.
With
this
approach,
we
have
innovated
and
rethought
the
traditional
OEM
business
model
and
positioned
ourselves
to
capture\nmore
value.\n•\nHighly
configurable
vehicle
platform
designed
and
engineered
in-house:
We
have
developed
critical
technologies
in-house
that
allow
for
our
vehicle
platform
to
be\nhighly
modular
and
efficient.
Over
70%
of
critical
functions
for
our
vehicles
are
delivered
in
this
platform,
enabling
us
to
develop
utilitarian
vehicles
that
can
address
a
wide\nrange
of
use
cases
and
applications.
Our
current
platform
architecture
can
be
the
base
to
multiple
vehicles,
addressing
different
segments
of
the
vehicle
market.
Additionally,\nour
vehicle
design
and
engineering
is
functionality-focused,
differentiated
by
its
simplicity
and
intended
superior
performance.
For
example,
our
drive
unit
has
less
than\n10%
of
the
parts
an
average
vehicle
with
an
internal
combustion
engine
would
have.
All
of
these
key
innovations
are
protected
intellectual
IP,
such
as
our
drive-by-wire\npackaging,
suspension
and
battery
pack
thermal
management,
differentiating
us
from
our

key
elements
to
our
growth
strategy
include:\n•\nIntroducing
Next-Generation

and
Variants:
By
leveraging
our
modular
platform,
we
anticipate
that
new
vehicle
models

variants
can
be
developed
more\nquickly
than
traditional
models.
The
new
models
and
variants
provide
flexibility
with
launching
new
use
cases,
price
alternatives
and
geographies.\n•\nBringing
Non-Canoo
Vehicles
into
our
Ecosystem:
Our
software
ecosystem
is
intended
to
incorporate
vehicles
not
produced
by
us
which
will
increase
the
services
we\noffer
our
customers.
We
aim
to
offer
customers
the
full
suite
of

in
all
of
their
cars
resulting
in
an
opportunity
to
generate
additional
revenue
streams.\n•\nGrowing
Market
Share
and
Expanding
Internationally:
We
believe
our
unique
modular
design,
proprietary
software
ecosystem,
customizable
customer
experience
and\nvehicle
technology
will
allow
us
to
gain
market
share
domestically.
As
we
grow,
we
may
expand
internationally
increasing
our
total
addressable
market.
Our
standard\nmodular
platform
will
drive
efficiency
in
homologation
in
new
markets.
The
platform’s
size
is
also
well
suited
for
international
markets.\n•\nIncreasing
Penetration
of
our
Digital

Over
time
we
anticipate
that
we
will
be
able
to
capture
a
higher
percentage
of
the
50-70
customer
transactions
over
a\nvehicle’s
lifecycle
as
we
develop
additional

Contents\nINTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY\nOur
ability
to
protect
our
material
intellectual
property
is
important
to
our
business.
We
rely
upon
a
combination
of
protections
afforded
to
owners
of
patents,
copyrights,\ntrade
secrets,
and
trademarks,
along
with
employee
and
third-party
non-disclosure
agreements
and
other
contractual
restrictions
to
establish
and
protect
our
intellectual
property\nrights.
In
particular,
unpatented
trade
secrets
in
the
fields
of
research,
development
and
engineering
are
an
important
aspect
of
our
business,
ensuring
that
our
technology
remains\nconfidential.
We
also
pursue
patent
protection
when
we
believe
we
have
developed
a
patentable
invention
and
the
benefits
of
obtaining
a
patent
outweigh
the
risks
of
making
the\ninvention
public
through
patent
filings.\nAs
of
December
31,
2021,
we
had
79
pending
or
allowed
U.S.
patents
and
59
pending
or
allowed
international
patent
applications.
Our
patents
and
patent
applications
are\nrelated
to,
among
other
things,
EV
platforms,
powertrain
technologies,
suspension
systems,
battery
systems,
drive-by-wire
design,
impact
features,
manufacturing
methods
and\nvehicle
and
product
design.
We
pursue
the
registration
of
our
domain
names
and
material
trademarks
and
service
marks
in
the
United
States
and
in
some
locations
abroad.
In
an\neffort
to
protect
our
brand,
as
of
December
31,
2021,
we
had
three
pending
U.S.
trademark
applications,
69
registered
international
trademarks,
and
eight
pending
international\ntrademark
applications.\nWe
regularly
review
our
development
efforts
to
assess
the
existence
and
patentability
of
new
inventions,
and
we
file
additional
patent
applications
when
it
is
determined
it\nwould
benefit
our
business
to
do
so.\nEMPLOYEES
AND
HUMAN
CAPITAL\nAs
an
organization,
we
pride
ourselves
on
attracting
and
developing
a
skilled
workforce
drawing
from
deep
automotive
and
technology
experience.
As
of
December
31,\n2021,
we
had
805
employees.
Approximately
67%
of
our
workforce
is
engaged
in
research
and
development,
manufacturing
and
related
engineering
and
testing
functions.\nWe
maintain
a
robust
compensation
and
benefits
program
to
attract,
retain,
incentivize
and
reward
the
talented
employees
who
contribute
to
our
business
and
who
share
in\nour
vision
to
create
a
cleaner
planet
and
bring
EVs
to
everyone.
In
addition
to
competitive
base
salary,
our
compensation
and
benefits
program
includes
heavily
subsidized\nhealthcare
and
insurance
benefits,
health
savings
accounts,
equity-based
compensation
awards,
401(k),
flexible
paid
time
off
and
paid
family
leave.
We
provide
our
employees
and\ntheir
families
with
access
to
a
variety
of
flexible
and
convenient
health
programs
that
allow
employees
to
customize
their
benefits
to
best
meet
the
needs
of
their
individual
families.\nWe
provide
an
employee
stock
purchase
program
for
employees
to
increase
their
ownership
and
investment
in
the
company.
We
also
provide
competitive
stock-based
awards
and\nperformance
bonus
targets
to
attract,
retain
and
motivate
employees,
consultants
and
directors.
Beyond
our
broad-based
stock
award
programs,
we
use
targeted
equity-based
grants\nfor
most
employees,
with
longer
term
vesting
conditions,
to
facilitate
the
future
performance
and
retention
of
key
people
with
critical
roles,
skills
and
experience.
These
programs\nare
continually
evaluated
and
updated
by
our
Board
of
Directors
(our
“Board”)
and
management
team,
as
appropriate,
to
reflect
the
maturation
of
our
business
and
to
remain\ncompetitive
in
attracting
and
retaining
skilled
talent.\nWe
have
committed
significant
time
and
resources
to
implementing
remote
work
and
on-site
safety
and
security
programs,
including
ramped
up
efforts
since
the
onset
of\nthe
COVID-19
pandemic
and
weekly
on-site
testing,
to
ensure
that
all
employees
are
confident
in
the
safety
and
security
of
their
physical
workspaces.
We
are
committed
to\nexploring
additional
health
and
safety
measures,
including
alternate
work
arrangements,
to
encourage
greater
employee
well-being
in
light
of
COVID-19.\nOur
management
team
invests
significant
time
and
attention
to
the
continued
development
of
our
workforce
and
to
our
employee
career
growth
and
retention
efforts.
We\ncontinue
ramping
up
additional
hiring
efforts
across
our
organization
as
we
develop
our
announced
vehicle
programs
and
software
offerings,
expand
our
geographic
footprint
and,\nin
particular,
as
we
build
out
and
staff
our
industrialization
facility,
tech
hubs,
sales
centers,
operations
offices
and
our
mega
microfactory.
In
2021,
our
employee
population
grew\nby
117%.
We
expect
accelerated
hiring
in
the
first
half
of
2022
as
we
build
our
facilities
and
staff
up
for
production
and
add
personnel
with
experience
in
areas
such
as
finance
and\naccounting,
and
will
continue
to
hire
in
such
areas,
to
continue
to
strengthen
our
governance
and
compliance
operations
as
a
new
public
company.
As
part
of
our
growth
and\nretention
strategy,
we
identify
and
recruit
in
particular
from
well-respected
OEMs,
tier
one
automotive
suppliers,
automotive
engineering
firms,
software
enterprises
and
high-\ngrowth
technology
companies,
while
also
incentivizing
talent
development
within
our
existing
organization.
As
we
transfer
key
operations
to
the
States
of
Arkansas
and
Oklahoma,\nwe
intend
to
partner
with
local
agencies
to
attract
residents
of
those
states,
which
include
a
significant
native
American
and
veteran
population.
We
are
committed
to
attracting
and\nretaining
a
workforce
which
is
ethnically,
racially
and
gender
diverse,
and
we
integrate
diversity,
equity
and
inclusion
principles
and
practices
into
our
corporate
recruiting,\nonboarding
and
long-term
retention
strategies.\n18\n',

are
invested
in
seeing
that
our
corporate
values
permeate
all

and
that
our
policies
and

reflect
our
commitment\nto
fostering
high

across
our
entire

We
promote
a
safe

by
conducting
annual

and\nemployees
alike.
Any
employee
with
concerns
related

of
fraud
or
abuse,
may
lodge
an

through
an\nexternally-managed
web-based
platform
or
hotline
without
fear
of

actively
seek
to
comply
with
all
local,
state
and
federal
employment
laws
and
we
monitor
current
and
emerging
labor
and
human
capital
management
risks
and\nmitigate
exposure
to
those
risks.\nGOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS\nWe
operate
in
an
industry
that
is
subject
to
extensive
environmental
regulation,
which
has
become
more
stringent
over
time.
The
laws
and
regulations
to
which
we
are\nsubject
govern,
among
others,
vehicle
emissions
and
the
storage,
handling,
treatment,
transportation
and
disposal
of
hazardous
materials
and
the
remediation
of
environmental\ncontamination.
Compliance
with
such
laws
and
regulations
at
an
international,
regional,
national,
provincial
and
local
level
is
an
important
aspect
of
our
ability
to
continue
our\noperations.\nEnvironmental
standards
applicable
to
us
are
established
by
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
countries
in
which
we
operate,
standards
adopted
by
regulatory
agencies
and\nthe
permits
and
licenses
issued
to
us.
Each
of
these
sources
is
subject
to
periodic
modifications
and
what
we
anticipate
will
be
increasingly
stringent
requirements.
Violations
of\nthese
laws,
regulations
or
permits
and
licenses
may
result
in
substantial
administrative,
civil
or
even
criminal
fines,
penalties
and
possibly
orders
to
cease
any
violating
operations
or\nto
conduct
or
pay
for
corrective
works.
In
some
instances,
violations
may
also
result
in
the
suspension
or
revocation
of
permits
or
licenses.\nEmissions\nCalifornia
has
greenhouse
gas
emissions
standards
that
closely
follow
the
standards
of
the
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(the
“EPA”).
The
registration
and
sale
of\nZero
Emission
Vehicles
(“ZEVs”)
in
California
could
earn
us
ZEV
credits
that
we
could
in
turn
sell
to
traditional
OEMs
looking
to
offset
emissions
from
their
traditional
internal\ncombustion
engine
vehicles
in
order
to
meet
California’s
emissions
regulations.
Other
U.S.
states
have
adopted
similar
standards
including
Colorado,
Connecticut,
Maine,\nMaryland,
Massachusetts,
New
Jersey,
New
York,
Oregon,
Rhode
Island
and
Vermont.
We
intend
to
take
advantage
of
these
regimes
by
registering
and
selling
ZEVs
in
these
other\nU.S.
states.\nZEV
credits
in
California
are
calculated
under
the
California
Air
Resources
Board
(“CARB”)
ZEV
Regulation
and
are
paid
in
relation
to
ZEVs
sold
and
registered
in\nCalifornia
including
Battery
Electric
Vehicles
(“BEVs”)
and
Fuel
Cell
Electric
Vehicles
(“FCEVs”).
The
ZEV
program
assigns
ZEV
credits
to
each
vehicle
manufacturer.
Vehicle\nmanufacturers
are
required
to
maintain
ZEV
credits
equal
to
a
set
percentage
of
non-electric
vehicles
sold
and
registered
in
California.
Each
vehicle
sold
and
registered
in
California\nearns
a
number
of
credits
based
on
the
drivetrain
type
and
the
all-electric
range
(“AER”)
of
the
vehicle
under
the
Urban
Dynamometer
Driving
Schedule
Test
Cycle.
Plug-in
hybrid\nvehicles
(“PHEVs”)
receive
between
0.4
and
1.3
credits
per
vehicle
sold
and
registered
in
California.
Battery
electric
and
fuel
cell
vehicles
receive
between
1
and
4
credits
per\nvehicle
sold
in
California,
based
on
range.
The
credit
requirement
was
9.5%
in
2020,
which
required
about
3%
of
sales
to
be
ZEVs.
The
credit
requirement
will
rise
to
22%
in
2025,\nwhich
will
require
about
8%
of
sales
to
be
ZEVs.
If
a
vehicle
manufacturer
does
not
produce
enough
EVs
to
meet
our
quota,
it
can
choose
to
buy
credits
from
other
manufacturers\nor
pay
a
$5,000
fine
for
each
credit
it
is
short.\nEPA
Emissions
and
Certificate
of
Conformity\nThe
U.S.
Clean
Air
Act
requires
that
we
obtain
a
Certificate
of
Conformity
issued
by
the
EPA
and
a
California
Executive
Order
issued
by
CARB
certifying
that
our\nvehicles
comply
with
all
applicable
emissions
and
related
certification
requirements.
A
Certificate
of
Conformity
is
required
for
vehicles
sold
in
states
covered
by
the
Clean
Air\nAct’s
standards
and
a
CARB
Executive
Order
is
required
for
vehicles
sold
in
California
and
states
that
have
adopted
California’s
stricter
standards
for
emissions
controls
related
to\nnew
vehicles
and
engines
sold
in
such
states.
States
that
have
adopted
the
California
standards
as
approved
by
EPA
also
recognize
the
CARB
Executive
Order
for
sales
of
vehicles.\nIn
addition
to
California,
there
are
13
other
states
that
have
either
adopted
or
are
in
the
process
of
adopting
the
stricter
California
standards,
including
New
York,
Massachusetts,\nVermont,
Maine,
Pennsylvania,
Connecticut,

Safety
and
Testing\nOur
vehicles
will
be
subject
to,
and
will
be
required
to
comply
with,
the
National
Traffic
and
Motor
Vehicle
Safety
Act,
as
amended,
and
numerous
regulatory\nrequirements
established
by
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
(“NHTSA”),
an
operating
administration
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Transportation,
including\napplicable
U.S.
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards
(“FMVSS”).
We
intend
for
our
Lifestyle
Vehicles
to
fully
comply
with
all
applicable
FMVSS
without
the
need
for
any\nexemptions,
and
expect
our
future
EVs
to
either
fully
comply
or
comply
with
limited
exemptions
related
to
new
technologies.
Additionally,
there
are
regulatory
changes
being\nconsidered
for
several
FMVSS,
and
while
we
anticipate
being
in
compliance
with
the
proposed
changes,
there
is
no
assurance
until
final
regulation
changes
are
enacted.\nAs
a
manufacturer,
we
must
self-certify
that
our
vehicles
meet
all
applicable
FMVSS,
as
well
as
the
NHTSA
bumper
standard,
or
otherwise
are
exempt,
before
the\nvehicles
can
be
manufactured
for
sale,
sold,
offered
for
sale,
introduced
or
delivered
for
introduction
in
interstate
commerce,
or
imported
into
the
United
States.
Numerous
FMVSS\nwill
apply
to
our
vehicles,
such
as
crash-worthiness
requirements,
crash
avoidance
requirements
and
EV-specific
requirements.
We
will
also
be
required
to
comply
with
other\nfederal
laws
and
regulations
administered
by
NHTSA,
including,
among
other
things,
ensuring
our
vehicles
do
not
contain
defects
related
to
motor
vehicle
safety,
recall\nrequirements,
the
corporate
average
fuel
economy
(“CAFE”)
standards,
Theft
Prevention
Act
requirements,
consumer
information
labeling
requirements,
reporting
required
notices,\nbulletins
and
other
communications,
TREAD
Act/Early
Warning
Information
reporting,
foreign
recall
reporting
and
owner’s
manual
requirements.\nThe
Automobile
Information
and
Disclosure
Act
requires
manufacturers
of
motor
vehicles
to
disclose
certain
information
regarding
the
manufacturer’s
suggested
retail\nprice,
optional
equipment
and
pricing.
In
addition,
this
law
allows
inclusion
of
city
and
highway
fuel
economy
ratings,
as
determined
by
EPA,
as
well
as
crash
test
ratings
as\ndetermined
by
NHTSA
if
such
tests
are
conducted.\nIf
we
expand
our
offerings
outside
of
the
United
States,
our
vehicles
will
be
subject
to
foreign
safety,
environmental
and
other
regulations.
Many
of
those
regulations
are\ndifferent
from
those
applicable
in
the
United
States
and
may
require
redesign
and/or
retesting.
For
example,
the
European
Union
(“E.U.”)
has
established
new
approval
and\noversight
rules
requiring
that
a
national
authority
certify
compliance
with
heightened
safety
rules,
emissions
limits
and
production
requirements
before
vehicles
can
be
sold
in
each\nE.U.
member
state,
the
initial
of
which
rules
were
rolled
out
on
September
1,
2020.
There
is
also
regulatory
uncertainty
regarding
how
these
rules
will
impact
sales
in
the
United\nKingdom
given
its
withdrawal
from
the
E.U.
These
changes
could
impact
the
rollout
of
new
vehicle
features
in
Europe.\nIn
addition
to
the
various
territorial
legal
requirements
we
are
obligated
to
meet,
our
Lifestyle
Vehicles
are
engineered
to
deliver
overall
5-star
performance
in
the
two\nmain
voluntary
vehicle
safety
performance
assessment
programs,
U.S.
NCAP
and
Euro
NCAP.
Five-star
is
the
maximum
attainable
score.
These
independent
organizations
have\nintroduced
a
number
of
additional
safety
related
tests
aimed
at
improving
the
safety
of
passenger
vehicles,
both
for
occupants
and
pedestrians
involved
in
collisions
with
vehicles.\nSome
of
these
tests
are
derived
from
the
legal
tests,
such
as
side
impact,
but
have
higher
performance
requirements.
Others
are
unique
to
the
program.

Manufacturer
and
Dealer
Regulation\nState
laws
regulate
the
manufacture,
distribution,
sale
and
service
of
automobiles,
and
generally
require
motor
vehicle
manufacturers
and
dealers
to
be
licensed
in
order
to\nsell
vehicles
directly
to
consumers
in
the
state.
Certain
states
do
not
permit
automobile
manufacturers
to
be
licensed
as
dealers
or
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
a
dealer,
or
otherwise\nrestrict
a
manufacturer’s
ability
to
deliver
or
service
vehicles.
The
state
laws
differ
for
sales
of
vehicles
directly
to
consumers
as
compared
to
sales
through
franchise-dealership\narrangements.
Should
we
pursue
either
of
these
options
in
combination
with
one
another,
or
also
in
combination
with
other
go-to-market
models,
such
as
a
subscription
offering,
we\nexpect
that
the
dealer
trade
associations
could
mount
challenges
to
our
business
model
by
challenging
the
legality
of
our
operations
in
court
and
employing
administrative
and\nlegislative
processes
to
attempt
to
prohibit
or
limit
our
ability
to
operate.
In
addition,
these
trade
associations
could
actively
lobby
state
licensing
agencies
and
legislators
to
interpret\nexisting
laws
or
enact
new
laws
in
ways
not
favorable
to
our
approaches
to
offering
vehicles
to
consumers;
however,
we
intend
to
actively
fight
any
such
efforts
to
limit
our
ability\nto
operate
and
to
proactively
support
legislation
supporting
our
go
to
market
strategy,
if
needed.\nBattery
Safety
and
Testing
Regulation\nOur
battery
pack
conforms
to
mandatory
regulations
that
govern
transport
of
“dangerous
goods,”
defined
to
include
lithium-ion
batteries,
which
may
present
a
risk
in\ntransportation.
The
governing
regulations,
which
are
issued
by
the
Pipeline
and
Hazardous
Materials
Safety
Administration,
are
based
on
the
UN
Recommendations
on
the
Safe\nTransport
of
Dangerous
Goods
Model
Regulations
and
related
UN
Manual
Tests
and
Criteria.
The
regulations
vary
by
mode
of
shipping
transportation,
such
as
by
ocean
vessel,\nrail,
truck
or
air.
Prior
to
launch,
we
plan
to
complete
all
applicable
transportation
tests
for
our
battery
packs,
demonstrating
our
compliance
with
applicable
regulations.
We
will
use\nlithium-ion
cells
in
the
high
voltage
battery
packs
in
our
vehicles.
The
use,
storage,
and
disposal
of
our
battery
packs
is
regulated
under
federal
law.\nOur
battery
packs
are
intended
to
meet
the
applicable
compliance
requirements
of
the
UN
Manual
of
Tests
and
Criteria
demonstrating
our
ability
to
ship
battery
packs
by\nany
method.\nThese
tests
include:\nAltitude
simulation
—
simulating
air
transport;\nThermal
cycling
—
assessing
cell
and
battery
seal
integrity;\nVibration
—
simulating
vibration
during
transport;\nShock
—
simulating
possible
impacts
during
transport;\nExternal
short
circuit
—
simulating
an
external
short
circuit;
and\nOvercharge
—
evaluating
the
ability
of
a
rechargeable
battery
to
withstand
overcharging.\nCOMPETITION\nWe
have
experienced,
and
expect
to
continue
to
experience,
intense
competition
from
a
number
of
companies,
particularly
as
the
transportation
sector
increasingly
shifts\ntowards
low-emission,
zero-emission
or
carbon
neutral
solutions.
Competing
vehicles
include
internal
combustion
vehicles
from
established
automobile
manufacturers
as
well
as\nalternative
fuel
and
electric
vehicles
manufactured,
or
to
be
manufactured,
by

Document(page_content='Table
of
Contents\nautomobile
manufacturers
are
developing
EVs.
In
recent
years,
interest
in
EVs
from
public
investors
has
made
access
to
public
capital
more
readily
available
for
newer
entrants
into\nthe
EV
market,
which
in
turn
has
increased
the
number
of
viable
competitors.
We
believe
the
primary
competitive
factors
in
the
EV
market
include,
but
are
not
limited
to:\n•\nproduct
availability;\n•\ntechnological
innovation;\n•\nproduct
quality,
reliability
and
safety;\n•\nservice
options;\n•\nproduct
performance;\n•\ndesign
and
styling;\n•\nproduct
price;\n•\nmanufacturing
efficiency;\n•\naccess
to
reliable
supply
for
raw
materials
and
parts,
including
batteries;\n•\nmarketing
and
consumer
adoption;
and\n•\naccess
to
and
efficient
allocation
of
capital.\nWe
believe
that
our
EVs
will
compete
favorably
on
the
basis
of
these
factors;
however,
many
of
our
current
and
potential
competitors
have
greater
financial,
technical,\nmanufacturing,
marketing
and
other
resources
than
we
do.
Our
competitors
may
be
able
to
deploy
greater
resources
to
the
design,
development,
manufacturing,
distribution,\npromotion,
sales,
marketing
and
support
of
their
alternative
fuel
vehicle
and
EV
programs.
Additionally,
our
competitors
may
also
have
greater
name
recognition,
longer
operating\nhistories,
larger
sales
forces,
more
traditional
sales
and
distribution
strategies,
broader
customer
and
industry
relationships
and
other
tangible
and
intangible
resources
than
we
do.\nThese
competitors
also
compete
with
us
in
recruiting
and
retaining
qualified
research
and
development,
manufacturing,
sales,
marketing
and
management
personnel,
as
well
as
in\nacquiring
technologies
complementary
to,
or
necessary
for,
our
products.
Additional
mergers
and
acquisitions
in
the
EV
market
may
result
in
even
more
resources
being\nconcentrated
in
our
competitors.\nAVAILABLE

your
evaluation
of
an
investment
in
our
Common
Stock.\n•\nWe
are
an
early
stage
company
with
a
history
of
losses
and
expect
to
incur
significant
expenses
and
continuing
losses
for
the
foreseeable
future.\n•\nWe
may
be
unable
to
adequately
control
the
costs
associated
with
our
operations.\n•\nOur
business
plans
require
a
significant
amount
of
capital.
If
we
are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
funding
or
do
not
have
access
to
capital,
we
will
be
unable
to
execute
our\nbusiness
plans
and
our
prospects,
financial
condition
and
results
of
operations
could
be
materially
adversely
affected.\n•\nIf
we
fail
to
successfully
build
and
tool
our
manufacturing
facilities
or
if
our
manufacturing
facilities
become
inoperable,
we
will
be
unable
to
produce
our
vehicles
and\nour
business
will
be
harmed.\n•\nWe
may
not
be
able
to
realize
the
non-dilutive
financial
incentives
offered
by
the
States
of
Oklahoma
and
Arkansas
where
we
will
develop
our
own
manufacturing\nfacilities.\n•\nDeveloping
our
own
manufacturing
facilities
for
production
of
our
EVs
could
increase
our
capital
expenditures
and
delay
or
inhibit
production
of
our
EVs.\n•\nWe
have
not
achieved
positive
operating
cash
flow
and,
given
our
projected
funding
needs,
our
ability
to
generate
positive
cash
flow
is
uncertain.\n•\nOur
financial
results
may
vary
significantly
from
period
to
period
due
to
fluctuations
in
our
operating
costs,
product
demand
and
other
factors.\n•\nOur
limited
operating
history
makes
evaluating
our
business
and
future
prospects
difficult
and
increases
the
risk
of
your

previously
identified
material
weaknesses
in
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting.
Although
the
weaknesses
previously
identified
have
been
remediated,
if\nwe
identify
additional
material
weaknesses
in
the
future
or
otherwise
fail
to
maintain
an
effective
system
of
internal
controls,
we
may
not
be
able
to
accurately
or
timely\nreport
our
financial
condition
or
results
of
operations,
which
may
adversely
affect
our
business
and

to
manage
our
growth
effectively,
we

the

our
future
capital
requirements
may
be
uncertain
and
actual
capital
requirements
may
be
different
from
those
we
currently
anticipate.
In
addition,
new
opportunities
for\ngrowth
in
future
product
lines
and
markets
may
arise
and
may
require
additional
capital.\nAs
of
December
31,
2021,
our
principal
source
of
liquidity
is
our
unrestricted
cash
balance
in
the
amount
of
$224.7
million.
As
an
early-stage
growth
company,
our
ability\nto
access
capital
is
critical.
We
expect
that
we
will
need
to
raise
additional
capital
in
order
to
continue
to
execute
our
business
plans
in
the
future,
and
we
plan
to
seek
equity
and/or\ndebt
financing,
including
by
offering
additional
equity,
and/or
equity-linked
securities,
through
one
or
more
credit
facilities
and
potentially
by
offering
debt
securities,
to
finance
a\nportion
of
our
future
expenditures.
The
ongoing
COVID-19
pandemic
and
resulting
negative
impact
on
the
global
macroeconomic
environment
and
capital
markets
as
well
as
other\ngeopolitical
forces
may
make
it
more
difficult
for
us
to
raise
additional
funds.\nThe
sale
of
additional
equity
or
equity-linked
securities
could
dilute
our
stockholders.
The
incurrence
of
indebtedness
would
result
in
increased
debt
service
obligations
and\ncould
result
in
operating
and
financing
covenants
that
would
restrict
our
operations
or
our
ability
to
pay
dividends
to
our
stockholders.
Our
ability
to
obtain
the
necessary
additional\nfinancing
to
carry
out
our
business
plans
or
to
refinance,
if
necessary,
any
outstanding
debt
when
due
is
subject
to
a
number
of
factors,
including
general
market
conditions
and\ninvestor
acceptance
of
our
business
model.
These
factors
may
make
the
timing,
amount,
terms
and
conditions
of
such
financing
unattractive
or
unavailable
to
us.
If
we
are
unable
to\nraise
sufficient
funds
on
favorable
terms,
we
may
have
to
significantly
reduce
our
spending,
delay
or
cancel
our
planned
activities
or
substantially
change
our
corporate
structure.\nWe
might
not
be
able
to
obtain
any
such
funding
or
we
might
not
have
sufficient
resources
to
conduct
our
business
as
projected,
both
of
which
could
mean
that
we
would
be
forced\nto
curtail
or
discontinue
our
operations
and
our
prospects,
financial
consolidated
results
of
operations
could
be
materially
adversely
affected,
in
which
case
our
investors
could
lose\nsome
or
all
of
their
investment.\nWe
have
not
achieved
positive
operating
cash
flow
and,
given
our
projected
funding
needs,
our
ability
to
generate
positive
cash
flow
is
uncertain.\nWe
have
had
negative
cash
flow
from
operating
activities
of
$300.8
million
and
$107.1
million
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
2021
and
2020,
respectively.
We
expect\nto
continue
to
have
negative
cash
flow
from
operating
and
investing
activities
for
2022
as
we
will
continue
to
incur
research
and
development,
sales
and
marketing,
and
general
and\nadministrative
expenses
and
make
capital
expenditures
in
our
efforts
to
develop

tool
our
facilities
for
production,
increase
sales,
engage
in
development
work
and
ramp
up\noperations,
including
capital
expenditures
directed
towards
the
manufacturing
of
our
EVs.
Our
business
also
will
at
times
require
significant
amounts
of
working
capital
to
support\nthe
growth
of
additional
EV
platforms
and
vehicle
models.
An
inability
to
generate
positive
cash
flow
may
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
raise
needed
capital
for
our
business
on\nreasonable
terms,
diminish
supplier
or
customer
willingness
to
enter
into
transactions
with
us,
and
have
other
adverse
effects
that
may
decrease
our
long-term
viability.
There
can\nbe
no
assurance
that
we
will
achieve
positive
cash
flow
in
the
near
future
or
at
all.\nOur
financial
results
may
vary
significantly
from
period
to
period
due
to
fluctuations
in
our
operating
costs,
product
demand
and
other
factors.\nWe
expect
our
period-to-period
financial
results
to
vary
based
on
our
operating
costs
and
product
demand,
which
we
anticipate
will
fluctuate
as
the
pace
at
which
we\ncontinue
to
design,
develop
and
manufacture
new
EVs,
increase
production
capacity
and
establish
or
expand
design,
research
and
development,
production,
sales
and
service\nfacilities.
Additionally,
our
revenue
from
period
to
period
may
fluctuate
as
we
identify
and
investigate
areas
of
demand,
adjust
volumes
and
add
new
product
derivatives
based
on\nmarket
demand
and
margin
opportunities,
develop
and
introduce
new
EVs
or
introduce
existing
EVs
to
new
markets
for
the
first
time.
As
a
result
of
these
factors,
we
believe
that\nquarter-to-quarter
comparisons
of
our
financial
results
are
not
and
will
not
be
necessarily
meaningful
for
the
foreseeable
future
and
that
these
comparisons
cannot
be
relied
upon
as\nindicators
of
future
performance.
Moreover,
our
financial
results
may
not
meet
expectations
of
equity
research
analysts,
ratings
agencies
or
investors,
who
may
be
focused
only
on\nquarterly
financial
results.
If
any
of
this
occurs,
the
trading
price
of
our
Common
Stock
could
fall
substantially,
either
suddenly
or
over
time.\nOur
limited
operating
history
makes
evaluating
our
business
and
future
prospects
difficult
and
increases
the
risk
of
your
investment.\nYou
must
consider
the
risks
and
difficulties
we
face
as
an
early
stage
company
with
a
limited
operating
history.
If
we
do
not
successfully
address

risks,
our

financial
condition

will
be
materially
and
adversely

are
no

secure

is
difficult
to

we

Although

In

result
in

loss
of

Contents\nOur
success
depends,
in
part,
on
our
ability
to
retain
our
key
personnel.
The
unexpected
loss
of
or
failure
to
retain
one
or
more
of
our
key
employees
could
adversely
affect\nour
business.
In
particular,
we
are
highly
dependent
on
the
services
and
reputation
of
Tony
Aquila,
our
Chief
Executive
Officer
and
Executive
Chair.
Mr.
Aquila
is
a
significant\ninfluence
on
and
driver
of
our
business
plan.
If
Mr.
Aquila
were
to
discontinue
his
service
due
to
death,
disability
or
any
other
reason,
or
if
his
reputation
is
adversely
impacted
by\npersonal
actions
or
omissions
or
other
events
within
or
outside
his
control,
we
would
be
significantly
disadvantaged.\nOur
success
also
depends,
in
part,
on
our
continuing
ability
to
identify,
hire,
attract,
train
and
develop
other
highly
qualified
personnel.
We
intend
to
continue
to
hire
a\nsignificant
number
of
additional
personnel,
including
software
engineers,
design
and
production
personnel
and
service
technicians
for
our
EVs
and
related
products,
including
our\nsoftware
offerings.
Competition
for
individuals
with
experience
designing,
producing
and
servicing
EVs
and
automotive
software
is
intense
particularly
given
current
labor\nshortages
as
a
consequence
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic.
As
a
result,
it
may
be
challenging
to
attract,
hire
and
retain
skilled
personnel,
in
particular
automotive
engineering
and\nsoftware
engineers.
The
geographic
location
of
the
areas
where
we
operate
or
intend
to
operate,
including
Arkansas,
Oklahoma,
Texas
and
Southern
California
may
exacerbate\nthese
challenges
given
that
availability
of
skilled
personnel
with
experience
in
EVs
and
automotive
software
may
not
be
as
readily
or
historically
available
in
certain
of
those\nlocations.\nMoreover,
in
the
near
term,
the
successful
launch
and
ramp
up
of
our
manufacturing
operations
will
require
the
hiring
of
substantial
numbers
of
new
personnel.
Because\nour
EVs
are
based
on
a
different
technology
platform
than
traditional
internal
combustion
engines,
individuals
with
sufficient
training
in
alternative
fuel
and
EVs
may
not
be\navailable
to
hire,
and
as
a
result,
we
expect
to
expend
significant
time
and
expense
training
any
newly
hired
employees.
The
timely
and
successful
launch
of
our
manufacturing\noperations,
and
thus
our
vehicle
programs,
is
dependent
upon
on
our
ability
to
identify,
hire,
attract,
train
and
retain
enough
qualified
personnel
to
develop
our
facilities
and
initiate\nproduction
of
our
EVs
at
scale.\nWe
face
significant
barriers
to
manufacture
and
bring
our
EVs
to
market,
and
if
we
cannot
successfully
overcome
those
barriers
our
business
will
be
negatively
impacted.\nThe
EV
industry
has
traditionally
been
characterized
by
significant
barriers
to
entry,
including
the
ability
to
meet
performance
requirements
or
industry
specifications,\nacceptance
by
end
users,
large
capital
requirements,
investment
costs
of
design
and
production,
long
lead
times
to
bring
EVs
to
market
from
the
concept
and
design
stage,
the
need\nfor
specialized
design
and
development
expertise,
regulatory
requirements,
establishing
a
brand
name
and
image
the
need
to
establish
sales
capabilities,
and
increasing
competition\nof
more
established
companies.
If
we
are
not
able
to
overcome
these
barriers,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
will
be
negatively
impacted
and
our\nability
to
grow
our
business
will
be
harmed.\nRisks
Related
to
our
Customers
and
Products\nOur
ability
to
develop
and
manufacture
EVs
of
sufficient
quality
and
appeal
to
customers
on
schedule
and
on
a
large
scale
is
unproven
and
still
evolving.\nOur
future
business
depends
in
large
part
on
our
ability
to
execute
our
plans
to
design,
develop,
manufacture,
market,
deploy
and
service
our
EVs
and
other
product\nofferings.\nEven
though
we
currently
expect
that
our
Lifestyle

starting
with
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle,
will
be
offered
in
late
2022,
with
our
other
vehicle
models
and\nconfigurations
to
come
shortly
thereafter,
we
have
significant
milestones
to
achieve
before
then
and
we
have
had
to
delay
and
reassess
our
launch
dates
various
times
in
the
past.\nOur
continued
development
and

of
our

some
of

critical

and

of
our

While
this\nallows
us
to
draw
from
such
third

industry
knowledge
and
expertise,
there
can
be
no
assurance
such
systems
and
components
will
be
successfully
developed
to
our\nspecifications
or
delivered
in
a
timely
manner
to
meet
our
program
timing
requirements.\nWe
will
depend
initially
on
revenue
generated
from
a
single
EV
model
and
in
the
foreseeable
future
will
be
significantly
dependent
on
a
limited
number
of
models.\nOur
business
will
initially
depend
substantially
on
the
success
of
our
first
vehicle
releases,
including
our
Lifestyle
Vehicles,
which
we
anticipate
will
be
delivered
to\ncustomers
beginning
in
late
2022,
the
MPDV
and
the
Pickup,
based
on
current
planning.
We
expect
to
be
ready
to
deliver
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
its
variants
first;
however,
at\nthis
time,
there
is
no
absolute
certainty
regarding
timing
of
production
of
this
model
or
our
other
models.
Historically,
automobile
customers
have
come
to
expect
a
variety
of\nvehicle
models
offered
in
a
manufacturer’s
fleet
and
new
and
improved
vehicle
models
to
be
introduced
frequently.
In
order
to
meet
these
expectations
as
well
as
evolving
areas
of\nmarket
demand
and
margin
opportunities,
we
plan
in
the
future
to
introduce
on
a
regular
basis
new
EV
models
as
well
as
enhance
versions
of
existing
vehicle
models.
The\nintroduction
of
new
EV
models
on
the
consumer
side
may
limit
customers’
willingness
to
purchase
older
model
EVs.
To
the
extent
our
product
variety
and
cycles
do
not
meet\nconsumer
expectations
or
cannot
be
manufactured
on
our
projected
timelines
and
in
line
with
cost
and
volume
targets,
our
financial
results
may
be
materially
adversely
affected.\nGiven
that
for
the
foreseeable
future,
our
business
will
depend
on
a
limited
number
of
models,
to
the
extent
a
particular
model
is
not
well-received
by
the
market,
our
sales
volume\ncould
be
materially
and
adversely
affected.
This
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nThere
is
no
guarantee
that
we
will
be
able
to
develop
our
software
platform,
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
or
that
if
we
are
able
to
develop
it,
that
we
will
obtain
the
revenue
and\nother
benefits
we
expect.\nIn
addition
to
our
vehicle
technology,
we
are
developing
a
software
platform
intended
to
aggregate
car
data
from
both
our
EVs
and
other
vehicles
to
deliver
certain\ninformation
to
our
customers.
We
believe
this
software
will
be
an
important
component
to
maximize
utility
and
value
from
the
vehicle
ownership
experience.
Leveraging
our
data\naggregation
platform,
we
are
planning
to
create
an
“application
store,”
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
to
centralize
vehicle
information
for
customers.
We
expect
some\nfunctionalities
will
be
packaged
with
the
vehicle,
while
others
are
expected
to
be
offered
as
upgradeable
options.
In
addition,
we
plan
to
assess
partnerships
with
third
parties
for\ncertain
services
accessed
through
our
software,
such
as
financing
or
insurance.
If
we
are
unable

or
market
the
Canoo
Digital
Ecosystem,
or
if\ncustomers
do
not
consider
it
valuable
or
do
not
use
it
as
intended,
we
may
not
achieve
the
benefits
we
expect
and
our
revenues
may
be
lower
than
expected,
all
of
which
could\nadversely
affect

which
may
further
offset

For
these
and
other
reasons,\nwe
could
experience
a
decline
in

and
as
a
result,
our
ability

Outsourcing
of

with\ncurrent
and
new
competitors
in
both
retaining
existing

will
be
adversely

focus
a
portion
of
our
selling
efforts
on
commercial
fleets,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle
and
MPDV,
we
may\nat
times
depend
upon
purchases
from
a
small
number
of

decrease
or

We

are
heavily
dependent
on
our
ability
to
develop,
maintain
and
strengthen
the
Canoo

If
we
are
unable

maintain
and
strengthen
our\nbrand,
we
may
lose
the
opportunity
to

positioning
our

depends
significantly
on
our
ability
to
provide
high
quality
EVs
and
engage\nwith
our
customers
as
intended,
and
we
have
limited
experience
in
these
areas.
In
addition,
our
ability
to
develop,
maintain
and
strengthen
the
Canoo
brand
will
depend
heavily
on\nthe
success
of
our
customer
sales
and
development.
Such
efforts
mainly
include
building
a
community
of
online
and
offline
users
engaged
with
our
mobile
application
and
branding\ninitiatives,
such
as
targeted
marketing
programs
through
direct
marketing
to
potential
partners
and
localities.
Such
efforts
may
be
non-traditional
and
may
not
achieve
the
desired\nresults.
To
reach
targeted
sales
goals,
we
may
be
required
to
change
our
customer
development
and
branding
practices,
which
could
result
in
substantially
increased
expenses,\nincluding,
for
example,
the
increased
need
to
use
traditional
media
such
as
television,
radio
and
print
and
engage
celebrity
talent
or
brand
ambassadors.
Many
consumers
value\nsafety
and
reliability
as
important
factors
in
choosing
a
vehicle
and
may
be
reluctant
to
acquire
a
vehicle
from
a
new
and
unproven
automotive
maker.
In
addition,
our
novel\ntechnology
and
design
may
not
align
with
existing
consumer
preferences.
If
we
do
not
develop
and
maintain
a
strong
brand
and
product
alignment
with
potential
customers,
our\nbusiness,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
will
be
materially
and
adversely
impacted.\nIn
addition,
if
incidents
occur
or
are
perceived
to
have
occurred,
whether
or
not
such
incidents
are
within
our
control,
we
could
be
subject
to
adverse
publicity.
Given
the\npopularity
of
social
media,
any
negative
publicity,
whether
true
or
not,
could
quickly
proliferate
and
harm
consumer
perceptions
and
confidence
in
the
Canoo
brand.
Furthermore,\nthere
is
the
risk
of
potential
adverse
publicity

Our
ability
to
successfully
position
our
brand
could
also
be
adversely
affected
by
perceptions
about
the
quality
of
our
competitors’
vehicles.\nIn
addition,
from
time
to
time,
our
EVs
may
be
evaluated
and
reviewed
by
third
parties.
Any
negative
reviews
or
reviews
which
compare
us
unfavorably
to
competitors\ncould
adversely
affect
consumer
perception
about
our
EVs.\nIf
our
EVs
fail
to
perform
as
expected,
our
ability
to
develop,
market
and
deploy
our
EVs
could
be
harmed.\nOur
EVs
may
contain
defects
in
design
and
production
that
may
cause
them
not
to
perform
as
expected
or
may
require
repair.
We
currently
have
a
limited
frame
of\nreference
by
which
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
our
EVs.
There
can
be
no
assurance
that
we
will
be
able
to
detect
and
fix
any
defects
in
our
EVs.
We
may
experience
recalls
in\nthe
future,
which
could
adversely
affect
our
brand
and
could
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
Our
EVs
may
not
perform
consistent\nwith
customers’
expectations
or
consistent
with
other
vehicles
which
may
become
available.
Any
product
defects
or
any
other
failure
of
our
EVs
and
software
to
perform
as\nexpected
could
harm
our
reputation
and
result
in
adverse
publicity,
lost
revenue,
delivery
delays,
product
recalls,
negative
publicity,
product
liability
claims
and
significant\nwarranty
and
other
expenses
and
could
have
a
material
adverse
impact
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
Additionally,
problems
and
defects\nexperienced
by
other
electric
consumer
vehicles
could
by
association
have
a
negative
impact
on
perception
and
customer
demand
for
our
EVs.\nOur
distribution
model
may
expose
us
to
risk
and
if
unsuccessful,
may
impact
our
business
prospects
and
results
of
operations.\nWe
expect
to
offer
certain
of
our
vehicles
through
direct
sales
through
our
website
for
fleets,
individuals,
and
volume
orders.
Direct
sales
to
customers
rather
than
through\nfranchised
dealerships,
is
a
model
of
vehicle
distribution
that
is
relatively
new
and
is
different
from
the
predominant
current
distribution
model
for
automobile
manufacturers
and,\nwith
limited
exceptions,
unproven.
In
addition,
we
are
also
exploring
vehicle
sales
through
alternative
distribution
channels,
including
physical
retailers
and
online
sales
platforms,\nas
well
as
franchise
dealers.\nWe
have
no
historical
experience
in
selling
or
leasing
vehicles
directly
or
through
alternative
channels,
and
therefore
this
model
may
require
significant
expenditures
and\nprovide
for
slower
expansion
than
the
traditional
dealer
franchise
system.
For
example,
we
will
not
be
able
to
utilize
long
established
sales
channels
developed
through
a
franchise\nsystem
to
increase
sales
volume.
Moreover,
we
will
be
competing
with
companies
with
well
established
distribution
channels.
Our
success
will
depend
in
large
part
on
our
ability
to\neffectively
develop
our
own
sales
channels
and
marketing
strategies.\nImplementing
a
direct
sales
and
leasing
model
is
subject
to
numerous
significant
challenges,
including
obtaining
permits
and
approvals
from
government
authorities,
and\nwe
may
not
be
successful
in
addressing
these
challenges
in
all
cases.
Further,
there
are
substantial
automotive
franchise
laws
in
place
in
many
geographies
around
the
world
and
we\nmight
be
exposed
to
significant
franchise
dealer
litigation
risks,
which
risks
may
be
further
increased
if
we
ultimately
elect
to
pursue
a
dealer
franchise
model
in
certain\njurisdictions
in
lieu
of
or
in
addition
to
a
direct
sales
and
leasing
model.\nIf
our
direct
sales
and
leasing
model
or
alternative
distribution
channels
do
not
develop
as
expected
or
develop
more
slowly
than
expected,
we
may
be
required
to
modify\nor
abandon
such
models,
which
could
materially
and
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations,
and
cash
flows.\nIn
addition,
we
still
expect
that
a
portion
of
our
distribution
will
be
conducted
under
a
consumer
subscription
model.
A
consumer
subscription
model
is
a
distinct
approach\nto
automotive
sales.
In
a
subscription
model,
we
would
provide
customers
direct
access
to
our
owned
EV
fleet
rather
than
selling
or
leasing
our
EVs
via
direct
sales.
The\nsubscription
model
of
vehicle
distribution
is
relatively
new
and
unproven
and
may
provide
for
slower
expansion
than
a
traditional
dealer
franchise
model.
In
addition,
as
the
EVs
in\na
subscription
fleet
age,
consumers
may
be
unwilling
to
pay
the
same
subscription
price
as
they
are
for
a
new
vehicle,
and
if
we
are
forced
to
discount
our
subscription
prices,
it\nmay
limit
our
ability
to
become
profitable.
If
consumers
determine
that
there
is
not
a
compelling
reason
to
switch
from
the
traditional
automotive
purchasing
models,
our\nsubscription
model
may
not
develop
as
expected
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
conduct
sales
through
such
a
model,
which
may
have
an
adverse
impact
on
our
results
of
operations.\n31\n',

face
legal,
regulatory
and
legislative
uncertainty
in
how
our

will
be
interpreted
under
existing
and
future
law
and
we
may
be
required
to
adjust
our\nbusiness
model
in
certain
jurisdictions
as
a
result.\nDirect
sales
models
and
subscription
models
are
each
relatively
novel
in
the
automotive
industry
and
may
be
subject
to
challenge
under
foreign,
federal,
state,
local
or\nmunicipal
laws
or
regulatory
restrictions
in
certain
jurisdictions.
We
may
be
required
to
seek
regulatory
or
policy
changes
to
clarify
uncertainties
in
existing
law
or
to
comply
with\ncertain
existing
state
and
local
laws
and
regulations
regarding
advertising,
sales,
referrals,
contract
and
pricing
disclosures,
delivery
of
EVs
to
consumers,
operating
showrooms,\ndata
collection,
vehicle
tracking,
service
and
repair,
recall
or
other
aspects
of
a
non-traditional
go-to-market
model.
In
addition,
dealer
and
other
trade
associations
may
mount\nchallenges
to
such
a
model
by
challenging
the
legality
of
our
operations
in
court
and
may
undertake
regulatory
and
legislative
efforts
to
propose
laws
that,
if
enacted,
would
prohibit\nor
severely
limit
our
ability
to
operate.
The
application
of
state
laws,
including
the
regulatory
and
legislative
process,
to
our
operations
and
prospect
continues
to
be
difficult
to\npredict.\nIf
we
cannot
overcome
such
legal,
regulatory
and
legislative
barriers
in
certain
jurisdictions,
we
may
be
required
to
adjust
our
consumer
go-to-market
strategies
or\ntimetable
in
order
to
comply
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
such
jurisdictions
or,
in
certain
other
jurisdictions,
we
may
be
prohibited
from
operating
altogether.
For
customers\nresiding
in
any
jurisdictions
in
which
we
will
not
be
allowed
to
market
or
directly
sell
EVs
based
on
our
direct
sales
model
or
a
subscription
model,
as
the
case
may
be,
we
may\nhave
to
arrange
alternate
sales
and
distribution
methods,
or
cease
sales
and
marketing
efforts
altogether.
These
workarounds
could
add
significant
complexity,
and
as
a
result,
costs,\nto
our
business.\nWe
expect
that
we
will
incur
significant
costs
in
defending
our
right
to
operate
in
accordance
with
a
direct
sales
model
or
subscription
model
in
many
jurisdictions,
which\nsubjects
us
to
substantial
risk
as
it
may
provide
for
slower
and
more
costly
expansion
of
our
business
than
may
be
possible
by
utilizing
more
traditional
approaches.
To
the
extent\nthat
efforts
to
block
or
limit
our
operations
are
successful,
or
if
we
are
required
to
comply
with
regulatory
and
other
requirements
applicable
to
vehicle
leasing,
franchise
laws
or\nrental
car
services,
our
revenue
and
growth
would
be
adversely
affected.\nFuture
product
recalls
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nAny
product
recall
in
the
future,
whether
it
involves
our
or
a
competitor’s
product,
may
result
in
negative
publicity,
damage
our
brand
and
materially
adversely
affect
our\nbusiness,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
In
the
future,
we
may
voluntarily
or
involuntarily,
initiate
a
recall
if
any
of
our
EVs
or
any
of
their
parts
prove
to
be\ndefective
or
noncompliant
with
applicable
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards.
These
types
of
disruptions
could
jeopardize
our
ability
to
fulfill
existing
contractual
commitments\nor
satisfy
demand
for
our
EVs
and
could
also
result
in
the
loss
of
business
to
our
competitors.
Such
recalls
also
involve
significant
expense
and
diversion
of
management
attention\nand
other
resources,
which
could
adversely
affect
our
brand
image,
as
well
as
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
If
a
large
number
of
vehicles
are
the\nsubject
of
a
recall
or
if
needed
replacement
parts
are
not
in
adequate
supply,
we
may
not
be
able
to
repair
and
re-deploy
recalled
vehicles
for
a
significant
period
of
time.\nIf
we
are
unable
to
establish
and
maintain
confidence
in
our
long-term
business
prospects
among
customers
and
analysts
and
within
our
industry
or
are
subject
to
negative\npublicity,
then
our
financial
condition,
operating
results,
business
prospects
and
access
to
capital
may
suffer
materially.\nCustomers
may
be
less
likely
to
purchase
our
EVs
if
they
are
not
convinced
that
our
business
will
succeed
or
that
our
service
and
support
and
other
operations
will\ncontinue
in
the
long
term.
Similarly,
suppliers
and
other
third
parties
will
be
less
likely
to
invest
time
and
resources
in
developing
business
relationships
with
us
if
they
are
not\nconvinced
that
our
business
will
succeed.
Accordingly,
in
order
to
build
and
maintain
our
business,
we
must
maintain
confidence
among
customers,
suppliers,
analysts,
ratings\nagencies
and
other
parties
in
our
EVs,
long-term
financial
viability
and
business
prospects.
Maintaining
such
confidence
may
be
particularly
complicated
by
certain
factors\nincluding
those
that
are
largely
outside
of
our
control,
such
as
our
limited
operating
history,
customer
unfamiliarity
with
our
EVs,
any
delays
in
developing
our
manufacturing\nfacilities
and
launching
or
scaling
production
as
well
as
delivery
and
service
operations
to
meet
demand,
competition
and
uncertainty
regarding
the
future
of
hybrid
electric
and\nEVs,
including
our
EVs
and
our
production
and

performance
compared
with
market
expectations.\n32\n',

EVs
is
different
than
servicing
vehicles
with
internal
combustion
engines
and
requires
specialized
skills,
including
high
voltage
training
and
servicing
techniques.
We\nplan
to
leverage
our
own
service
facilities
or
partner
with
third-parties,
where
possible,
to
perform
some
or
all
of
the

there
can

Although
such
servicing

may
have
experience
in

they
will\ninitially
have
limited
experience
in

There
can
be
no

that

will
adequately
address
the

we
and

In

issues
with
respect

maintenance
in
a
cost-effective
manner.
Customer

we
may
be

quickly
enough
to

We
also
may
be
unable

risk
that
government
support
for
EV
and
alternative
fuel
solutions
and
charging
infrastructure
may
deploy
slower
than
promised
and
may
not
continue.\nWhile
the
prevalence
of
charging
stations
generally
has
been
increasing,
charging
station
locations
are
significantly
less
widespread
than
gas
stations.
Some
potential\ncustomers
may
choose
not
to
purchase
our
vehicles
because
of
the
lack
of
a
more
widespread
charging
infrastructure.
Further,
to
provide
our
customers
with
access
to
sufficient\ncharging
infrastructure,
we
will
rely
on
the
availability
of,
and
successful
integration
of
our
vehicles
with,
third-party
charging
networks.
Any
failure
of
third-party
charging\nnetworks
to
meet
customer
expectations
or
needs,
including
quality
of
experience,
could
impact
the
demand
for
EVs,
including
ours.
For
example,
where
charging
bays
exist,
the\nnumber
of
vehicles
could
oversaturate
the
available
charging
bays,
leading
to
increased
wait
times
and
dissatisfaction
for
customers.
In
addition,
given
our
limited
experience
with\ncharging
solutions,
there
could
be
unanticipated
challenges
which
may
hinder
our
ability
to
connect
customers
to
charging
solutions
or
make
accessing
charging
solutions
costlier\nthan
anticipated.
To
the
extent
we
are
unable
to
meet
user
expectations
or
experience
difficulties
in
connecting
customers
to
charging
solutions,
our
reputation
and
business,\nprospects,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations,
and
cash
flows
may
be
materially
and
adversely
affected.\nInsufficient
reserves
to
cover
warranty
expense,
future
part
replacement
needs
or
other
vehicle
repair
requirements,
including
any
potential
software
upgrades,
could\nmaterially
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nOnce
we
begin
commercial
production
of
our
EVs,
we
will
need
to
maintain
reserves
to
cover
warranty,
part
replacement
and
other
vehicle
repair
needs,
including
any\npotential
software
upgrades
or
warranty
claims.
If
our
reserves
are
inadequate
to
cover
future
warranty
and
maintenance
requirements
on
our
EVs,
our
business,
prospects,
financial\ncondition
and
operating
results
could
be
materially
and
adversely
affected.
We
may
become
subject
to
significant
and
unexpected
expenses
as
well
as
claims
from
our
customers,\nincluding
loss
of
revenue
or
damages.
There
can
be
no
assurance
that
then-existing
reserves
will
be
sufficient
to
cover
all
claims.\nPreorders
for
EVs
are
cancellable.\nOur
EVs
are
still
in
development.
As
a
result,
we
offer
reservations,
or
preorders,
for
our
Lifestyle
Vehicles,
our
Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicles
and
our
Pickup
that
are\ncancellable
without
penalty,
including
full
refund
of
any
deposit
payments
(generally
$100
per
vehicle
reserved).
Given
the
anticipated
lead
times
between
preorders
and
the
date
of\ndelivery
of
our
EVs,
there
is
a
heightened
risk
that
customers
who
preorder
a
vehicle
may
ultimately
decide
not
to
convert
into
binding
contracts
to
purchase
to
our
EVs
due
to\npotential
changes
in
customer
preferences,
competitive
developments
and
other
factors.
As
a
result,
no
assurance
can
be
made
that
preorders
will
not
be
cancelled
or
that
preorders\nwill
result
in
a
final
purchase,
and
any
such
cancellations
could
harm
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nRisks
Related
to
our
Production
Processes
and
Supply
Chain\nIf
we
fail
to
successfully
build
and
tool
our
manufacturing
facilities
or
if
our
manufacturing
facilities
become
inoperable,
we
will
be
unable
to
produce
our
vehicles
and
our\nbusiness
will
be
harmed.\nWe
intend
to
have
an
advanced
industrialization
facility
located
in
Bentonville,
Arkansas,
and
a
mega
microfactory
facility
located
in
Pryor,
Oklahoma.
We
have
entered\ninto
or
are
currently
negotiating
leases
with
respect
to
these
facilities.
Construction
and
tooling
of
our
facilities
for
production
of
our
vehicles
and
our
future
expansion
plans
are\ncomplicated
and
present
significant
challenges.
Among
such
challenges,
our
launch
plans
contemplate
a
compressed
time
period
between
the
construction
and
tooling
of
our
sites\nand
the
start
of
commercial
production.
As
with
any
large-scale
capital
project,
our
construction
and
tooling
efforts
could
be
subject
to
delays,
cost
overruns
or
other
complications.\nThese
risks
could
be
exacerbated
because
we
are
building
our
facilities
from
the
ground
up
to
support
our
electric
vehicle
production
processes,
which
differ
substantially
from\ntraditional
automobile
production
processes
for
which
expertise
is
more
readily
available.
In
order
to
commence
commercial
production
at
our
facilities
in
Arkansas
and
Oklahoma,\nwe
will
also
need
to
hire
and
train
a
significant
number
of
employees
and
integrate
a
yet-to-be-fully-developed
supply
chain.
A
failure
to
commence
commercial
production
on\nschedule
would
lead
to
additional
costs
and
would
delay
our
ability
to
generate
meaningful
revenues.
In
addition,
it
could
prevent
us
from
gaining
the
confidence
of
potential\ncustomers,
spur
cancellations
of
reservations
for
our
vehicles
and
open
the
door
to
increased
competition.
All
of
the
foregoing
could
hinder
our
ability
to
successfully
launch
and\ngrow
our
business
and
achieve
a
competitive
position
in
the
market.\n34\n',

own
manufacturing
facilities
for

could
increase
our

and
the
State
of

the
States
have
offered\nnon-dilutive
financial

is
dependent
on
the
continued

for
the
battery
packs
used
in
our

and
we
have
contracted
with
Panasonic
for
the
initial
supply
of
our\nbattery

While
we
are
excited
about
this
partnership,
if
Panasonic
is
unable
to
supply
battery
cells
because
of
shortages
of
raw
materials,
increased
demand
from
other
EV\nmanufacturers,
delays
in

and
transportation
or
other
factors,
we

be
required
to

We
may
not
be
able
to
find
an
alternative
supplier
in
time
or\nat

Any
disruption
in
our
supply
of
battery
cells
could
disrupt
production
of
our
EVs.\nFurthermore,
fluctuations
or
shortages
in
petroleum
and
other
economic
conditions
may
cause
us
to
experience
significant
increases
in
freight
charges
and
material
costs.\nSubstantial
increases
in
the
prices
for
our
raw
materials
and
components
or
prices
charged
to
us,
such
as
those
charged
by
battery
cell
suppliers,
would
increase
our
operating
costs,\nand
could
reduce
our
margins
if
the
increased
costs
cannot
be
recouped
through
increased
vehicle
prices.
Any
attempts
to
increase
product
prices
in
response
to
increased
material\ncosts
could
result
in
cancellations
of
orders
and
therefore
materially
and
adversely
affect
our
brand,
image,
business,
prospects
and
operating
results.\nWe
depend
upon
third
parties
to
manufacture
and
to
supply
key
semiconductor
chip
components
necessary
for
our
vehicles.
We
do
not
have
long-term
agreements
with
all
of\nour
semiconductor
chip
manufacturers
and
suppliers,
and
if
these
manufacturers
or
suppliers
become
unwilling
or
unable
to
provide
an
adequate
supply
of
semiconductor\nchips,
with
respect
to
which
there
is
a
global
shortage,
we
would
not
be
able
to
find
alternative
sources
in
a
timely
manner
and
our
business
would
be
adversely
impacted.\nSemiconductor
chips
are
a
vital
input
component
to
the
electrical
architecture
of
our
vehicles,
controlling
wide
aspects
of
the
vehicles’
operations.
Due
to
our
reliance
on\nthese
semiconductor
chips,
we
are
subject
to
the
risk
of
shortages
and
long
lead
times
in
their
supply.
We
are
still
in
the
process
of
identifying
alternative
manufacturers
for\nsemiconductor
chips.
We
have
in
the
past
experienced,
and
may
in
the
future
experience,
semiconductor
chip
shortages,
and
the
availability
and
cost
of
these
components
would
be\ndifficult
to
predict.
For
example,
our
manufacturers
may
experience
temporary
or
permanent
disruptions
in
their
manufacturing
operations
due
to
equipment
breakdowns,
labor\nstrikes
or
shortages,
natural
disasters,
component
or
material
shortages,
cost
increases,
acquisitions,
insolvency,
changes
in
legal
or
regulatory
requirements,
or
other
similar\nproblems.\nIn
particular,
continued
increased
demand
for
semiconductor
chips
after
2020,
due
in
part
to
the
COVID-19
pandemic
and
increased
demand
for
consumer
electronics
that\nuse
these
chips,
has
resulted
in
a
severe
global
shortage
of
chips
in
2021,
which
we
expect
to
continue
through
2022.
As
a
result,
our
ability
to
source
semiconductor
chips
used
in\nour
vehicles
has
been
adversely
affected.
This
shortage
may
result
in
increased
chip
delivery
lead
times,
delays
in
the
production
of
our
vehicles,
and
increased
costs
to
source\navailable
semiconductor
chips.
To
the
extent
this
semiconductor
chip
shortage
continues,
and
we
are
unable
to
mitigate
the
effects
of
this
shortage,
our
ability
to
deliver
sufficient\nquantities
of
our
vehicles
to
fulfill
our
preorders
and
to
support
our
growth
through
sales
to
new
customers
would
be
adversely
affected.
In
addition,
we
may
be
required
to
incur\nadditional
costs
and
expenses
in
managing
ongoing
chip
shortages,
including
additional
research
and
development
expenses,
engineering
design
and
development
costs
in
the
event\nthat
new
suppliers
must
be
onboarded
on
an
expedited
basis.
Further,
ongoing
delays
in
production
and
shipment
of
vehicles
due
to
a
continuing
shortage
of
semiconductor
chips\nmay
harm
our
reputation
and
discourage
additional
preorders
and
vehicle
sales,
and
otherwise
materially
and
adversely
affect
our
business
and
operations.\nWe
are
dependent
on
our
suppliers,
some
of
which
are
single
or
limited
source
suppliers,
and
the
inability
of
these
suppliers
to
deliver
necessary
components
of
our
EVs
at\nprices
and
volumes,
performance
and
specifications
acceptable
to
us,
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nWe
rely
on
third-party
suppliers
for
the
provision
and
development
of
many
of
the
key
components
and
materials
used
in
our
EVs.
While
we
plan
to
obtain
components\nfrom
multiple
sources
whenever
possible,
some
of
the
components
used
in
our
EVs
will
be
purchased
by
us
from
a
single
source,
at
least
initially
or
for
certain
markets.
For\nexample,
our
batteries
will
initially
be
purchased
from
a
single
source,
Panasonic.

Related
to
Our
Industry
and
Competitive
Landscape\nThe
automotive
market
is
highly
competitive,
and
we
may
not
be
successful
in
competing
in
this
industry.\nWe
face
intense
competition
in
bringing
our
EVs
to
market.
Both
the
automobile
industry
generally,
and
the
EV
segment
in
particular,
are
highly
competitive,
and
we
will\nbe
competing
for
sales
with
both
EV
manufacturers
and
traditional
automotive
companies.
Many
major
automobile
manufacturers
have
EVs
available
today
and
other
current
and\nprospective
automobile
manufacturers
are
also
developing
EVs.
In
recent
quarters,
interest
in
EVs
from
public
investors
has
made
access
to
public
capital
more
readily
available
for\nnewer
entrants
into
the
EV
market,
which
in
turn
has
increased
the
number
of
viable
competitors.
The
influx
of
new,
well-capitalized
entrants,
some
of
whom
may
be
better\ncapitalized
than
us
or
differently
focused
in
areas
of
the
EV
market
with
greater
demand,
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and\noperating
results.
Many
of
our
current
and
potential
competitors
may
have
significantly
greater
financial,
technical,
manufacturing,
marketing
and
other
resources
than
we
do
and\nmay
be
able
to
devote
greater
resources
to
the
design,
development,
manufacturing,
distribution,
promotion,
sale
and
support
of
their
products,
including
their
EVs.
Additionally,\nmany
of
our
current
and
potential
competitors
may
have
greater
name
recognition,
longer
operating
histories,
larger
sales
forces,
established
servicing
networks
and
broader\ncustomer
and
industry
relationships
and
other
resources
than
we
do.
These
competitors
also
compete
with
us
in
recruiting
and
retaining
qualified
research
and
development,
sales,\nmarketing,
servicing,
software
and
hardware
engineering,
and
management
personnel,
as
well
as
with
investment
opportunities
and
acquiring
technologies
complementary
to,
or\nnecessary
for,
our
EVs.
Additional
mergers
and
acquisitions
may
result
in
even
more
resources
being
concentrated
in
our
competitors.
There
are
no
assurances
that
customers
will\nchoose
our
EVs
over
those
of
our
competitors,
or
over
internal
combustion
engines
vehicles.
We
expect
additional
competitors
will
continue
to
enter
the
industry.
We
also
compete\nwith
companies
offering
automotive
software
products
which
may
be
comparable
or
fall
into
similar
demand
segments
as
our
own.\nWe
expect
competition
in
our
industry
to
continue
to
intensify
based
on
the
current
and
future
competitive
landscape
in
light
of
an
increasing

demand
for

depends,
in
part,
on
the
continuation
of
current
trends
resulting
from
dependence
on
fossil
fuels.
Extended
periods
of
low
gasoline
or
other
petroleum-\nbased
fuel
prices
could
adversely
affect
demand
for
our
EVs,
which
would
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nWe
believe
that
much
of
the
present
and
projected
demand
for
EVs
results
from
concerns
about
volatility
in
the
cost
of
gasoline
and
other
petroleum-based
fuel,
the\ndependency
of
the
United
States
on
oil
from
unstable
or
hostile
countries,
government
regulations
and
economic
incentives
promoting
fuel
efficiency
and
alternative
forms
of\nenergy,
as
well
as
the
belief
that
climate
change
results
in
part
from
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels.
If
the
cost
of
gasoline
and
other
petroleum-based
fuel
decreased
significantly,
the\noutlook
for
the
long-term
supply
of
oil
to
the
United
States
improved,
the
government
eliminated
or
modified
our
regulations
or
economic
incentives
related
to
fuel
efficiency
and\nalternative
forms
of
energy,
or
if
there
is
a
change
in
the
perception
that
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
negatively
impacts
the
environment,
the
demand
for
EVs
could
be
reduced,
and\nour
business
and
revenue
may
be
harmed.\nGasoline
and
other
petroleum-based
fuel
prices
have
been
extremely
volatile,
and
we
believe
this
continuing
volatility
will
persist.
Lower
gasoline
or
other
petroleum-\nbased
fuel
prices
over
extended
periods
of
time
may
lower
the
perception
in
government
and
the
private
sector
that
cheaper,
more
readily
available
energy
alternatives
should
be\ndeveloped
and
produced.
If
gasoline
or
other
petroleum-based
fuel
prices
remain
at
deflated
levels
for
extended
periods
of
time,
the
demand
for
EVs
may
decrease,
which
would\nhave
an
adverse

and
conditions
for
all
or
a
significant
portion
of
the
government
grants,
loans
and
other
incentives
for
which
we\nmay
apply.
As
a
result,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
may
be
adversely
affected.\nWe
anticipate
applying
for
federal
and
state
grants,

and

and
other
economic
incentives
under
government
programs
designed
to
stimulate
the
economy
and\nsupport

We
anticipate
that

there
will
be
new

for
us
to
apply
for

from
federal,

Our

is
subject
to
the

Even\nif

potentially
resulting
in
the
loss
of

and
a
decrease
in

which
could

Our
success
depends,
at
least\nin
part,
on
our
ability
to
protect
our
core
technology
and

To
accomplish
this,
we
will
rely
on
a
combination
of
patents,
trade
secrets
(including
know-how),\nemployee

third-party
nondisclosure
agreements,

protection
of
our

will
be
important
to
our
future
business
opportunities.
However,
the
measures
we
take
to
protect
our

by
others
may
not
be
effective
for
various
reasons,
including
the

may
not

scope
of
our

not
be
broad

associated
with

Further,

If
another
party
has
filed

same
or
similar
subject
matter
as
we
have,
we
may
not
be
entitled
to
the
protection
sought

the
public

matter
prior
to
our

of
a

or
other
bars
to\npatentability,
depending
on
the

may
prevent

cannot
be
certain
whether
the
claims
included
in
a
filed
patent\napplication
will
ultimately
be
allowed
in
the
applicable
issued

Further,
the
scope
of

is
often
difficult
to
determine.
As
a
result,
we
cannot\nbe
certain
that
the
patent
applications
that

issue,
or
that

will
afford

In

our\ncompetitors
may
design
around
our
issued

which
may
adversely
affect
our
business,

EVs
make
use
of
lithium-ion
battery
cells,
which
have
been
observed
to
catch
fire
or
vent
smoke
and
flame.\nThe
battery
packs
in
our
EVs
use
lithium-ion
cells.
On
rare
occasions,
lithium-ion
cells
can
rapidly
release
the
energy
they
contain
by
venting
smoke
and
flames
in
a\nmanner
that
can
ignite
nearby
materials
as
well
as
other

While
we
have
taken
measures
to
enhance
the
safety
of
our
battery
designs,
a
field
or

failure
of

could
occur
in

which
could
subject
us
to
lawsuits,
product
recalls,
or
redesign
efforts,
all
of
which
would
be
time-consuming
and
expensive.
Also,
negative
public\nperceptions
regarding
the
suitability
of
lithium-ion
cells
for
automotive
applications
or
any
future
incident
involving
lithium-ion
cells
such
as
a
vehicle
or
other
fire,
even
if
such\nincident
does
not
involve
our
EVs,
could
seriously
harm
our

addition,
we

of
our

are
expected
to

of
lithium-ion
cells
at

may
cause
disruption
to
the
operation
of

A
safety
issue
or
fire
related
to

could
disrupt
operations
or
cause

delays.
Such
damage\nor

could
lead
to
adverse

and
potentially
a

Moreover,
any
failure
of
a
competitor’s
EV
or

storage
product
may
cause
indirect

to:\n•\nincreased
support
for

of
established
automobile
manufacturers
with
large
employment
bases,
high
fixed
costs
and
business
models
based
on\nthe
internal

which
could
lead
them
to

that
could
reduce
the
compliance
costs
of
such
established
manufacturers
or
mitigate
the\neffects
of
government
efforts
to
promote
alternative
fuel
vehicles.\nTo
the
extent
the
laws
change,
our
vehicles
may
not
comply
with
applicable
federal,
state
and
local,
or
foreign
laws,
which
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
our
business.\nCompliance
with
changing
regulations
could
be
burdensome,
time
consuming
and
expensive.
To
the
extent
compliance
with
new
regulations
is
cost
prohibitive,
our
business,\nprospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
would
be
adversely
affected.\nFuture
changes
to

may
have
a
negative
impact
upon
our

state
and
local
laws,
our
vehicles
will
comply
with
all
applicable
FMVSS
laws
when
they
are
offered\nto
the

However,
to
the
extent
the
laws
change,
new
laws
are
introduced,
or
if
we
introduce
new
vehicles
in
the
future,
some
or
all
of
our
vehicles
may
not
comply
with\napplicable
international
federal,
state
or
local
laws.
Further,
certain
federal,
state
and
local
laws
and
industry
standards
currently
regulate
electrical
and
electronics
equipment.\nAlthough
standards
for
EVs
are
not
yet
generally
available
or
accepted
as
industry
standards,
our
vehicles
may
become
subject
to
international,
federal,
state,
and
local
regulation
in\nthe
future.
Compliance
with
these
regulations
could
be
burdensome,
time
consuming,
and
expensive.\nOur
vehicles
are
subject
to
environmental
and
safety
compliance
with
various
federal
and
state
regulations,
including
regulations
promulgated
by
the
Environmental\nProtection
Agency,
the
National
Highway
Traffic
and
Safety
Administration
and
various
state
boards,
and
compliance
certification
is
required
for
each
new
model
year.
The
cost
of\nthese
compliance
activities
and
the
delays
and
risks
associated
with
obtaining
approval
can
be
substantial.
The
risks,
delays
and
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
such\ncompliance
could
be
substantial.\nIn
addition,
our
EVs
involve
a
novel
design
and
new
technology,
including
for
example
our
steer-by-wire
technology,
side
facing
seats
and
street
view
window,
that
may\nnot
meet
existing
safety
standards
or
require
modification
in
order
to
comply
with
various
regulatory
requirements.
Compliance
with
regulatory
requirements
is
expensive,
at
times\nrequiring
the
replacement,
enhancement
or
modification
of
equipment,
facilities
or
operations.
There
can
be
no
assurance
that
we
will
be
able
to
maintain
our
profitability
by\noffsetting
any
increased
costs
of
complying
with
future
regulatory
requirements.\nOur
EVs
are
subject
to
motor
vehicle
standards
and
the
failure
to
satisfy
such
mandated
safety
standards
would
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business
and
operating\nresults.\nAll
vehicles
sold
must
comply
with

In
the
United
States,
vehicles
that
meet

In
the
United
States,
California
adopted
the
California
Consumer
Privacy
Act
(“CCPA”),
which\nbecame
effective
in
January
2020.
The
CCPA
establishes
a
privacy
framework
for
covered
businesses,
including
an
expansive
definition
of
personal
information
and
data
privacy\nrights
for
California
residents.
The
CCPA
includes
a
framework
with
potentially
severe
statutory
damages
and
private
rights
of
action
for
data
breaches.
Specifically,
the
CCPA\nrequires
covered
businesses
to
provide
new
disclosures
to
California
residents,
provide
them
new
ways
to
opt-out
of
the
sale
of
personal
information.
The
CCPA
provides
for
civil\npenalties
for
violations
and
statutory
damages
ranging
from
$100
to
$750
per
violation,
which
is
expected
to
increase
data
breach
class
action
litigation
and
result
in
exposure
to\ncostly
legal
judgments
and
settlements.
The
CCPA
will
be
expanded
on
January
1,
2023,
when
the
California
Privacy
Rights
Act
(“CPRA”)
becomes
operative.
The
CPRA
will,\namong
other
things,
give
California
residents
the
ability
to
limit
the
use
of
certain
sensitive
personal
information,
further
restrict
the
use
of
cross-contextual
advertising,
establish\nrestrictions
on
the
retention
of
personal
information,
expand
the
types
of
data
breaches
subject
to
the
CCPA’s
private
right
of
action,
provide
for
increased
penalties
for
CPRA\nviolations
concerning
California
residents
under
the
age
of
16,
and
establish
a
new
California
Privacy
Protection
Agency
to
implement
and
enforce
California’s
privacy
laws.
As
we\nexpand
our
operations,
the
CCPA
may
increase
our
compliance
costs
and
potential
liability.
Some
observers
have
noted
that
the
CCPA
could
mark
the
beginning
of
a
trend
toward\nmore
stringent
privacy
legislation
in
the
United
States.
Other
states
have
begun
to
propose
or
enact
similar
laws.
Virginia
enacted
the
Virginia
Consumer
Data
Protection
Act\n(“CDPA”)
that
may
impose
obligations
on
us
similar
to
or
more
stringent
than
those
we
may
face
under
other
data
protection
laws,
which
will
become
operative
on
January
1,\n2023.
In
Europe,
the
General
Data
Protection
Regulation
(EU)
2016/679
(GDPR),
applies
across
the
European
Economic
Area
(EEA).
Also,
notwithstanding
the
United
Kingdom's\n(UK)
withdrawal
from
the
European
Union,
by
operation
of
the
so-called
“UK
GDPR,”
the
GDPR
continues
to
apply
in
substantially
equivalent
form
in
the
context
of
UK-focused\npersonal
data
processing
operations.
Collectively,
European
data
protection
laws
(including
the
GDPR)
are
wide-ranging
in
scope
and
impose
numerous,
significant
and
complex\ncompliance
burdens
in
relation
to
the
processing
of
personal
data
such
as,
without
limitation,
with
regard
the
international
transfer
of
personal
data
out
of
the
European
Economic\nArea,
Switzerland
and
United
Kingdom.
European
data
protection
laws
also
provide
for
more
robust
regulatory
enforcement
and
greater
penalties
for
noncompliance
than
previous\ndata
protection
laws,
including,
for
example,
under
the
GDPR,
fines
of
up
to
€20
million
or
4%
of
global
annual
revenue
of
any
noncompliant
organization
for
the
preceding\nfinancial
year,
whichever
is
higher.
The
GDPR
also
confers
regulators
with
the
ability
to
impose
personal
data
processing
penalties;
and
a
private
right
of
action
for
data
subjects\nand
consumer
associations
to
lodge
complaints
with
supervisory
authorities,
seek
judicial
remedies,
as
well
as
obtain
compensation
for
damages
resulting
from
violations
of
the\nGDPR.
Compliance
with
any
applicable
privacy
and
data
security
laws
and
regulations
is
a
cost
and
time-intensive
process,
and
we
may
be
required
to
put
in
place
additional\nmechanisms
to
comply
with
such
laws
and
regulations.\nWe
publish
privacy
policies
and
other
documentation
regarding
our
collection,
processing,
use
and
disclosure
of
personal
information
and/or
other
confidential\ninformation.
Although
we
endeavor
to
comply
with
our
published
policies
and
other
documentation,
we
may
at
times
fail
to
do
so
or
may
be
perceived
to
have
failed
to
do
so.\nMoreover,
despite
our
efforts,
we
may
not
be
successful
in
achieving
compliance
if
our
employees,
contractors,
service
providers
or
vendors
fail
to
comply
with
our
published\npolicies
and
documentation.
Such
failures
can
subject
us
to
potential
local,
state
and
federal
action
if
they
are
found
to
be
deceptive,
unfair,
or
misrepresentative
of
our
actual\npractices.
Claims
that
we
have
violated
individuals’
privacy
rights
or
failed
to
comply
with
data
protection
laws
or
applicable
privacy
notices
even
if
we
are
not
found
liable,
could\nbe
expensive
and
time-consuming
to
defend
and
could
result
in
adverse
publicity
that
could
harm
our
business.\n47\n"",

Revenue
Service
(the

with
respect

and
certain
aspects

The

has
already

Act.
In

and
do
not

and
may
never

We
have
recorded
a
full
valuation
allowance
related
to
our
net
operating
loss
carryforwards
and\nother
deferred
tax
assets
due
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
ultimate
realization
of
the
future
benefits
of
those
assets.\nThe
imposition
of
tariffs
and
the
resulting
consequences,
could
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nOur
business
is
subject
to
risks
relating
to
the
imposition
of
tariffs
and
other
trade
barriers,
which
may
make
it
more
costly
for
us
to
import
certain
raw
materials
and
other\ncomponents
and,
in
the
future,
export
our
EVs.
In
recent
years,
the
U.S.
government
has
imposed
tariffs
on
certain
foreign
goods,
including
steel
and
certain
vehicle
parts,
which\nhave
begun
to
result
in
increased
costs
for
goods
imported
into
the
United
States.
In
response
to
these
tariffs,
a
number
of
U.S.
trading
partners
have
imposed
retaliatory
tariffs
on
a\nwide
range
of
U.S.
products,
which
makes
it
more
costly
for
us
to
export
our
EVs
to
those
countries.
If
we
are
unable
to
pass
price
increases
on
to
our
customer
base
or
otherwise\nmitigate
the
costs,
or
if
demand
for
our
exported
EVs,
if
any,
decreases
due
to
the
higher
cost,
our
operating
results
could
be
materially
adversely
affected.
In
addition,
further
tariffs\nmay
be
proposed
at
any
time
by
the
U.S.
and
our
trading
partners,
as
response
to
various
geopolitical
events,
and
additional
trade
restrictions
could
be
implemented
on
a
broader\nrange
of
products
or
raw
materials.
The
resulting
environment
of
tariffs,
trade
restrictions
or
other
practices
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,\nfinancial
condition,
operating
results,
customers,
suppliers
and
the
global
economy.\nWe
are
subject
to
governmental
export
and
import
controls
and
laws
that
could
subject
us
to
liability
if
we
are
not
in
compliance
with
such
laws.\nOur
EVs
are
subject
to
export
control,
import
and
economic
sanctions
laws
and
regulations,
including
the
U.S.
Export
Administration
Regulations,
U.S.
Customs\nregulations
and
various
economic
and
trade
sanctions
regulations
administered
by
the
U.S.
Treasury
Department’s
Office
of
Foreign
Assets
Control.
Exports
of
our
EVs
and\ntechnology
must
be
made
in
compliance
with
these
laws
and
regulations.
If
we
fail
to
comply
with
these
laws
and
regulations,
we
and
certain
of
our
employees
could
be
subject
to\nsubstantial
civil
or
criminal
penalties,
including
the
possible
loss
of
export
or
import
privileges;
fines,
which
may
be
imposed
on
us
and
responsible
employees
or
managers;
and,
in\nextreme
cases,
the
incarceration
of
responsible
employees
or
managers.\nIn
addition,
changes
to
our
EVs,
or
changes
in
applicable
export
control,
import,
or
economic
sanctions
laws
and
regulations
may
create
delays
in
the
introduction
and
sale\nof
our
EVs
and
solutions
or,
in
some
cases,
prevent
the
export
or
import
of
our
EVs
to
certain
countries,
governments,
or
persons
altogether.
Any
change
in
export,
import,
or\neconomic
sanctions
laws
and
regulations,
shift
in
the
enforcement
or
scope
of
existing
laws
and
regulations,
or
change
in
the
countries,
governments,
persons,
or
technologies\ntargeted
by
such

could
also
result
in
decreased
use
of
our
EVs,
as
well
as
our
decreased
ability
to

our
EVs
to

likely
adverse

of
action
arising
under
the
Securities
Act.
This
provision
may
limit
our
stockholder’s
ability
to
bring
a\nclaim
in
a
judicial
forum
that
it
finds
favorable
for
disputes
with
us
and
our
directors,
officers
or
other
employees
and
may
have
the
effect
of
discouraging
lawsuits
against
our\ndirectors,
officers
and
other
employees.
Furthermore,
our
stockholders
may
be
subject
to
increased
costs
to
bring
these
claims,
and
the
exclusive
forum
provision
could
have
the\neffect
of
discouraging
claims
or
limiting
investors’
ability
to
bring
claims
in
a
judicial
forum
that
they
find
favorable.\nIn
addition,
the
enforceability
of
similar
exclusive
forum
provisions
in
other
companies’
certificates
of
incorporation
has
been
challenged
in
legal
proceedings,
and
it
is\npossible
that,
in
connection
with
one
or
more
actions
or
proceedings
described
above,
a
court
could
rule
that
this
provision
in
our
Certificate
of
Incorporation
is
inapplicable
or\nunenforceable.
In
March
2020,
the
Delaware
Supreme
Court
issued
a
decision
in
Salzburg
et
al.
v.
Sciabacucchi,
which
found
that
an
exclusive
forum
provision
providing
for\nclaims
under
the
Securities
Act
to
be
brought
in
federal
court
is
facially
valid
under
Delaware
law.
We
intend
to
enforce
this
provision,
but
we
do
not
know
whether
courts
in
other\njurisdictions
will
agree
with
this
decision
or
enforce
it.
If
a
court
were
to
find
the
exclusive
forum
provision
contained
in
our
Certificate
of
Incorporation
to
be
inapplicable
or\nunenforceable
in
an
action,
we
may
incur
additional
costs
associated
with
resolving
such
action
in
other
jurisdictions,
which
could
harm
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition\nand
operating
results.\n51\n',

of

issuance
of

of
our

will
increase
the

eligible

and\nresult
in
dilution
to
our
stockholders.\nAs
of
December
31,
2021,
warrants
to
purchase
an
aggregate
of
approximately
23.8
million
shares
of
our
Common
Stock
were
outstanding
and
exercisable
(subject
to
the\nconditions
set
forth
in
the
Warrant
Agreement).
The
exercise
price
of
these
warrants
is
$11.50
per
share.
To
the
extent
such
warrants
are
exercised,
additional
shares
of
our\nCommon
Stock
will
be
issued,
which
will
result
in
dilution
to
the
holders
of
our
Common
Stock
and
increase
the
number
of
shares
eligible
for
resale
in
the

Sales
of\nsubstantial
numbers
of
such
shares
in
the
public
market
or
the
fact
that
such
warrants
may
be
exercised
could
adversely
affect
the
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock.\nThere
is
no
guarantee
that
our
warrants
will
be
in
the
money
at
the
time
they
are
exercisable,
and
they
may
expire
worthless.\nThe
exercise
price
for
our
warrants
is
$11.50
per
share
of
Common
Stock.
There
is
no
guarantee
that
the
warrants
will
remain
in
the
money
throughout
the
time
they
are\nexercisable
and
prior
to
their
expiration,
and
as
such,
the
warrants
may
expire
worthless.\nWe
may
amend
the
terms
of
the

in
a
manner
that
may
be
adverse
to
holders
with
the
approval
by
the
holders
of
at
least
50%
of
the
then-outstanding
public\nwarrants.
As
a
result,
the
exercise
price
of
your
warrants
could
be
increased,
the
exercise
period
could
be
shortened
and
the
number
of
shares
of
our
Common
Stock
purchasable\nupon
exercise
of
a
warrant
could
be
decreased,
all
without
your
approval.\nOur
warrants
are
issued
in
registered
form
under
a
warrant
agreement
(the
“Warrant
Agreement”)
between
us
and
Continental
Stock
Transfer
&
Trust
Company,
as\nwarrant
agent.
The
Warrant
Agreement
provides
that
the
terms
of
the
warrants
may
be
amended
without
the
consent
of
any
holder
to
cure
any
ambiguity
or
correct
any
defective\nprovision,
but
requires
the
approval
by
the
holders
of
at
least
50%
of
the
then-outstanding
public
warrants
to
make
any
change
that
adversely
affects
the
interests
of
the
registered\nholders
of
public
warrants.
Accordingly,
we
may
amend
the
terms
of
the
public
warrants
in
a
manner
adverse
to
a
holder
if
holders
of
at
least
50%
of
the
then-outstanding
public\nwarrants
approve
of
such
amendment.
Although
our
ability
to
amend
the
terms
of
the
public
warrants
with
the
consent
of
at
least
50%
of
the
then-outstanding
public
warrants
is\nunlimited,
examples
of
such
amendments
could
be
amendments
to,
among
other
things,
increase
the
exercise
price
of
the
warrants,
convert
the
warrants
into
cash
or
stock
(at
a
ratio\ndifferent
than
initially
provided),
shorten
the
exercise
period
or
decrease
the
number
of
shares
of
our
Common
Stock
purchasable
upon
exercise
of
a
warrant.\nWe
may
redeem
unexpired
warrants
prior
to
their
exercise
at
a
time
that
is
disadvantageous
to
warrant
holders,
thereby
making
such

worthless.\nWe
have
the
ability
to
redeem
outstanding
warrants
at
any
time
after
they
become
exercisable
and
prior
to

at
a
price
of
$0.01

$18.00

(as

for

any
20
trading
days
within
a
30
trading-day
period
ending
on
the
third

day
prior
to
the
date
on
which
we
give
proper
notice
of
such
redemption
and
provided
certain\nother
conditions
are
met.
If
and
when
the
warrants
become
redeemable
by
us,
we
may
exercise
our
redemption
right
even
if
we
are
unable
to
register
or
qualify
the
underlying\nsecurities
for
sale
under
all
applicable
state
securities
laws.
Redemption
of
the
outstanding
warrants
could
force
you
(a)
to
exercise
your
warrants
and
pay
the
exercise
price
therefor\nat
a
time
when
it
may
be
disadvantageous
for
you
to
do
so,
(b)
to
sell
your
warrants
at
the
then-current
market
price
when
you
might
otherwise
wish
to
hold
your
Warrants
or
(c)
to\naccept
the
nominal
redemption
price
which,
at
the
time
the
outstanding
warrants
are
called
for
redemption,
is
likely
to
be
substantially
less
than
the
market
value
of
your
warrants.\nIn
addition,
we
may
redeem
your
warrants
after
they
become
exercisable
for
a
number
of
shares
of
Common
Stock
determined
based
on
the
redemption
date
and
the
fair\nmarket
value
of
our
Common
Stock.
Any
such
redemption
may
have
similar
consequences
to
a
cash
redemption
described
above.
In
addition,
such
redemption
may
occur
at
a
time\nwhen
the
warrants
are
“out-of-the-money,”
in
which
case,
you
would
lose
any
potential
embedded
value
from
a
subsequent
increase
in
the
value
of
our
Common
Stock
had
your\nwarrants
remained
outstanding.\n52\n',

impact
of
which
is
difficult
to
predict,
which
may
significantly
harm
our

face
various
risks
related
to
public
health
issues,
including
epidemics,
pandemics
and
other
outbreaks,
including
the
ongoing
COVID-19
pandemic.
The
COVID-19\npandemic
has
resulted
in
government
authorities
implementing
numerous
measures
to
try
to
contain
the
virus,
such
as
travel
bans
and
restrictions,
quarantines,
social
distancing\npractices,
stay-at-home
or
shelter-in-place
orders,
and
business
shutdowns.
These
measures
have,
and
may
continue
to
have,
an
adverse
impact
on
our
business
and
operations,\nincluding,
for
example,
inefficiencies
with
testing
and
manufacturing
of
our
EVs,
which
cannot
be
conducted
remotely
in
all
cases,
increased
costs
associated
with
working\nremotely
or
otherwise
operating
in
compliance
with
regulatory
restrictions
related
to
the
pandemic,
or
reduced
availability
of

These

may
continue
to
have
an\nadverse
impact
on
our
sales
and
marketing
activities

the
production

of
our
EVs,
and
are
likely
to
continue
to
have
adverse
impacts
to
the
operations
of
our
suppliers,\nvendors
and
business
partners.
For
example,
we
may
experience
an
increase
in

party
services
necessary
for
the
commercial\nproduction
of
our
EVs,
the
development
of
our
manufacturing
operations,
and
other
business
activities.
The
COVID-19
pandemic
also
could
limit
the
ability
of
our
customers,\nsuppliers,
vendors
and
business
partners
to
perform,
including
third-party
suppliers’
ability
to
provide
components
and
materials
used
in
our
EVs.
In
addition,
we
have
asked
that\nour
employees
who
are
able
to
do
so
work
remotely,
and
while
we
have
since
begun
partial
re-opening
of
certain
offices,
it
is
possible
that
continued
widespread
remote
work\narrangements
could
continue
to
have
a
negative
impact
on
our
operations,
the
execution
of
our
business
plans,
and
productivity
and
availability
of
key
personnel
and
other\nemployees
necessary
to
conduct
our
business,
as
well
as
our
contractors
and
service
providers
who
perform
critical
services
for
us.
There
is
no
certainty
that
such
actions
will
be\nsufficient
to
mitigate
the
risks
posed
by
the
virus
and
its
numerous
variants.
Throughout
the
pandemic,
we
have
also
seen
regulatory
approaches
vary
widely
by
jurisdiction,
we\nface
significant
uncertainty
regarding
whether
and
when
existing
regulations
will
be
reduced
or
alternatively,
in
some
case,
re-instated.
If
significant
portions
of
our
workforce
or\ncontractors
and
service
providers
are
unable
to
work
effectively,
including
due
to
illness,
quarantines,
social
distancing,
government
actions
or
other
restrictions
in
connection
with\nthe
COVID-19
pandemic,
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results
may
be
materially
adversely
impacted.\nOn
a
macroeconomic
level,
the
COVID-19
pandemic
has
created
significant
volatility
in
the
global
economy
including
changes
in
consumer
and
business
behavior,\npandemic
fears
and
market
downturns,
in
addition
to
restrictions
on
business
and
individual
activities.
The
spread
of
COVID-19
has
created
a
disruption
in
the
manufacturing,\ndelivery
and
overall
supply
chain
of
vehicle
manufacturers
and
suppliers.
On
the
consumer
side,
the
pandemic
has
led
to
a
global
decrease
in
vehicle
sales
and
usage
in
markets\naround
the
world.
These
factors
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
the
demand
for
EVs.
Under
difficult
economic
conditions,
potential
customers
may
seek
to
reduce
spending\nby
foregoing
EVs
for
other
more
traditional
options.\nThere
are
no
comparable
recent
events
which
provide
guidance
as
to
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
COVID-19
and
a
pandemic,
and,
as
a
result,
the

To
the
extent
the
COVID-19
pandemic
adversely
affects
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results,
it
may
also
have
the\neffect
of
heightening
many
of
the
other
risks
described
in
this
“Risk
Factors”
section.\nSome
members
of
our
management
team
have
limited
experience
in
operating
a
public
company.\nSome
of
our
senior
officers
have
limited
experience
in
the
management
of
a
publicly
traded
company.
Such
members’
limited
experience
could
expose
us
to
risks,\nespecially
with
respect
to
the
application
and
interpretation
of
accounting
policies,
practices
or
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
required
of
public
companies.
We
continue\nto
upgrade
our
finance
and
accounting
systems
to
an
enterprise
system
suitable
for
a
public
company,
which
will
assist
us
in
the
timely
filing
of
required
reports
with
the
SEC
and\ncomplying
with
Section
404
of
the
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act
of
2002
(the
“Sarbanes-Oxley
Act”).
If
we
are
unable
to
continue
hiring
or
are
unable
to
retain
senior
officers
and
other\npersonnel
with
public
company
experience,
in
particular
public
company
reporting
experience,
our
filings
with
the
SEC
may
be
delayed
or
we
may
suffer
errors
with
respect
to
our\ninternal
control
over
financial
reporting
or
otherwise
with
respect
to
our
public
filings,
some
of
which
could
be
material
errors
or
result
in
claims
of
fraud
or
misrepresentation.\nWe
incur
increased
costs
and
administrative
burden
as
a
result
of
operating
as
a
public
company,
and
our
management
devotes
substantial
time
to
maintaining
compliance.\nAs
a
public
company,
we
incur
significant
legal,
accounting
and
other
expenses
that
we
did
not
incur
as
a
private
company,
and
these
expenses
may
increase
even
more\nnow
that
we
are
no
longer
an
emerging
growth
company.
As
a
public
company,
we
are
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
Exchange
Act,
the
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act,
the
Dodd-Frank\nWall
Street
Reform
and
Consumer
Protection
Act
of
2010,
and
the
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
and
to
be
promulgated
thereunder,
Public
Company
Accounting
Oversight\nBoard
(the
“PCAOB”),
as
well
as
rules
adopted,
and
to
be
adopted,
by
the
SEC
and
the
Nasdaq
Stock
Market
LLC
(“Nasdaq”).
Our
management
and
other
personnel
devote
a\nsubstantial
amount
of
time
to
maintaining
compliance
with
these
requirements,
Moreover,
these
rules
and
regulations
substantially
increase
our
legal
and
financial
compliance
costs\nand
make
some
activities
more
time-consuming
and
costly.
The
increased
costs
may
increase
our
net
loss
and
comprehensive
loss.\nIt
may
also
be
more
expensive
to
obtain
director
and
officer
liability
insurance.
We
cannot
always
predict
or
estimate
the
amount
or
timing
of
additional
costs
it
may
incur\nto
respond
to
these
requirements.
The
impact
of
these
requirements
could
also
make
it
more
difficult
for
us
to
attract
and
retain
qualified
persons
to
serve
on
our
board
of
directors,\nour
board
committees
or
as
executive
officers.
The
additional
reporting
and
other
obligations
imposed
by
these
rules
and
regulations
may
increase
legal
and
financial
compliance\ncosts
and
the
costs
of
related
legal,
accounting
and
administrative
activities.
These
increased
costs
may
require
us
to
divert
a
significant
amount
of
money
that
could
otherwise
be\nused
to
expand
the
business
and
achieve
strategic
objectives.
Furthermore,
if
any
issues
in
complying
with
the
above
requirements
are
identified
(for
example,
if
we
or
our\nindependent
registered
public
accounting
firm
identifies
additional
material
weaknesses
or
significant
deficiency
in
the
internal
control
over
financial
reporting),
we
could
incur\nadditional
costs
rectifying
those
issues,
and
the
existence
of
those
issues
could
adversely
affect
our
reputation
or
investor
perceptions
of
it.
Advocacy
efforts
by
stockholders
and\nthird
parties
may
also
prompt
additional
changes
in
governance
and
reporting
requirements,
which
could
further
increase
costs.\nIncreased
scrutiny
of
our
environmental,
social
or
governance
responsibilities
have
and
will
likely
continue
to
result
in
additional
costs
and
risks,
and
may
adversely\nimpact
our
reputation,
employee
retention,
and
willingness
of
customers
and
suppliers
to
do
business
with
us.\nThere
is
increasing
focus
from
customers,
consumers,
employees,
regulators,
lenders
and
other
stakeholders
concerning
environmental,
social
and
governance
(“ESG”)\nmatters,
including
corporate
citizenship
and
sustainability.
Additionally,
public
interest
and
legislative
pressure
related
to
public
companies'
ESG
practices
continues
to
grow.
If
our\nESG
practices
fail
to
meet
regulatory
requirements
or
stakeholders'
evolving
expectations
and
standards
for
responsible
corporate
citizenship
in
areas
including
environmental\nstewardship,
support
for
local
communities,
Board
and
employee
diversity,
human
capital
management,
employee
health
and
safety
practices,
corporate
governance
and\ntransparency
and
employing
ESG
strategies
in
our
operations,
our
brand,
reputation
and
employee
retention
may
be
negatively
impacted,
and
customers
and
suppliers
may
be\nunwilling
to
do
business
with
us.\nApplying
ESG
approaches
in
our
manufacturing,
servicing
and
other
processes
is
likely
to
incur
additional
costs,
with
growing
regulatory
requirements
and

addition,
as
we
work
to
align
our
ESG
practices
with
industry
standards,
we
have
expanded
and,
in
the
future,
will
likely
continue
to
expand
our
public
disclosure
in\nthese
areas.
From
time
to
time,
we
may
communicate
certain
initiatives
or
goals
regarding
environmental
and
sustainability

and
other
ESG
matters
either
through
disclosures\nin
our
public

or
documents
that
we
publish
on
our
website.
In
the
U.S.,
amongst
other
regulatory
efforts,
in
February
2021,
the
Acting
Chair
of
the
SEC
issued
a
statement\ndirecting
the
Division
of
Corporation
Finance
to
enhance
its
focus
on
climate-related
disclosure
in
public
company
filings,
and
in
March
2021,
the
SEC
announced
the
creation
of
a\nClimate
and
ESG
Task
Force
in
the
Division
of
Enforcement.
We
expect
to
incur
additional
costs
and
require
additional
resources
to
monitor,
report
and
comply
with
regulatory\nrequirements
and
our
own-developed
ESG
practices.
The
standards
for
tracking
and
reporting
on
ESG
matters
are
relatively
new,
have
not
been
harmonized
and
continue
to
evolve.\nThe
disclosure
frameworks
we
choose
to
align
with,
if
any,
may
change
from
time
to
time
and
may
result
in
a
lack
of
consistent
or
meaningful
comparative
data
from
period
to\nperiod.
Ensuring
there
are
systems
and
processes
in
place
to
comply
with
various
ESG
tracking
and
reporting
obligations
will
require
management
time
and
expense.
In
addition,\nour
processes
and
controls
may
not
always
comply
with
evolving
standards
for
identifying,
measuring,
and
reporting
ESG
metrics,
our
interpretation
of
reporting
standards
may\ndiffer
from
those
of
others
and
such
standards
may
change
over
time,
any
of
which
could
result
in
significant
revisions
to
our
goals
or
reported
progress
in
achieving
such
goals.\nOur
employees
and
independent
contractors
may
engage
in
misconduct
or
other
improper
activities,
which
could
have
an
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial\ncondition
and
operating
results.\nWe
are
exposed
to
the
risk
that
our
employees
and
independent
contractors
may
engage
in
misconduct
or
other
illegal
activity.
Misconduct
by
these
parties
could
include\nintentional,
reckless
or
negligent
conduct
or
other
activities
that
violate
laws
and
regulations,
including
production
standards,
U.S.
federal
and
state
fraud,
abuse,
data
privacy
and\nsecurity
laws,
other
similar
non-U.S.
laws
or
laws
that
require
the
true,
complete
and
accurate
reporting
of
financial
information
or
data.
It
is
not
always
possible
to
identify
and\ndeter
misconduct
by
employees
and
other
third
parties,
and
the
precautions
we
take
to
detect
and
prevent
this
activity
may
not
be
effective
in
controlling
unknown
or
unmanaged\nrisks
or
losses
or
in
protecting
us
from
governmental
investigations
or
other
actions
or
lawsuits
stemming
from
a
failure
to
be
in
compliance
with
such
laws
or
regulations.
In\naddition,
we
are
subject
to
the
risk
that
a
person
or
government
could
allege
such
fraud
or
other
misconduct,
even
if
none
occurred.
If
any
such
actions
are
instituted
against
us,
and\nwe
are
not
successful
in
defending
ourselves
or
asserting
our
rights,
those
actions
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating\nresults,
including,
without
limitation,
the
imposition
of
significant
civil,
criminal
and
administrative
penalties,
damages,
monetary
fines,
disgorgement,
integrity
oversight
and\nreporting
obligations
to
resolve
allegations
of
non-compliance,
imprisonment,
other
sanctions,
contractual
damages,
reputational
harm,
diminished
profits
and
future
earnings
and\ncurtailment
of
our
operations,
any
of
which
could
adversely
affect
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.\nWe
expect
initial
launch
of
our
EVs
to
be
concentrated
in
certain
targeted
jurisdictions,
putting
it
at
risk
of
region-specific
disruptions.\nWe
expect
to
initially
launch
our
EV
offerings
in
limited
jurisdictions.
Accordingly,
our
business
and
results
of
operations
are
particularly
susceptible
to
adverse
economic,\nregulatory,
political,
weather
and
other
conditions
in
other
markets
that
may
become
similarly
concentrated.
Further,
as
compared
to
our
competitors
who
operate
on
a
wider\ngeographic
scale,
any
adverse
changes
or
events
in
our
targeted
jurisdictions
may
expose
our
business
and
results
of
operations
to
more
significant
risks.\nWe
may
become
subject
to
product
liability
claims,
including
possible
class
action
and
derivative
lawsuits,
which
could
harm
our
financial
condition
and
liquidity
if
we
are
not\nable
to
successfully
defend
or
insure
against
such
claims.\nProduct
liability
claims,
even
those
without
merit
or
those
that
do
not
involve
our
EVs,
could
harm
our
business,
prospects,
financial
condition
and
operating
results.
The\nautomobile
industry
in
particular
experiences
significant
product
liability
claims,
and
we
face
inherent
risk
of
exposure
to
claims
in
the
event
our
EVs
do
not
perform
or
are
claimed\nto
not
have
performed
as
expected.
As
is
true
for
other
EV
suppliers,
we
expect
in
the
future
that
our
EVs
will
be
involved
in
crashes
resulting
in
death
or
personal
injury.\nAdditionally,
product
liability
claims
that
affect
our
competitors
or
suppliers
may
cause
indirect
adverse
publicity
for
us
and
our
EVs.\nA
successful
product
liability
claim
against
us
could
require
us
to
pay
a
substantial
monetary
award.
Our
risks
in
this
area
are
particularly
pronounced
given
we
have
not\ndeployed
our
EVs
for
consumer
use
to
date
and
the
limited
field
experience
of
our
EVs.
Moreover,
a
product
liability
claim
against
us
or
our
competitors
could
generate
substantial\nnegative
publicity
about
our
EVs
and
business
and
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
brand,
business,
prospects,\n56\n',

for
new
or
revised
financial
accounting
standards
and
certain
other
exemptions
and
reduced
reporting
requirements
provided
by
the
JOBS
Act.\nAccordingly,
we
have
previously
not
been
required
to
provide
an
auditor’s
attestation
report
on
our
system
of
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
pursuant
to
Section
404(b)
of\nthe
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.
Based
on
the
Company’s
aggregate
worldwide
market
value
of
voting
and
non-voting
common
equity
held
by
non-affiliates
as
of
June
30,
2021,
we
lost\nour
emerging
growth
company
status
and
became
a
“large
accelerated
filer”
beginning
with
this
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K
for
the
year
ending
December
31,
2021.
As
a
result,\nour
independent
registered
public
accounting
firm
was
required
for
the
first
time
to
provide
the
attestation
report
on
our
system
of
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
in
this\nAnnual
Report
on
Form
10-K
and
will
be
required
to
do
so
in
subsequent
Annual
Reports.
If
we
are
unable
to
in
any
such
Annual
Report
assert
that
our
internal
control
over\nfinancial
reporting
is
effective
or
if
our
independent
registered
public
accounting
firm
is
unable
to
express
an
opinion
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
our
internal
control
over
financial\nreporting,
or
expresses
an
adverse
opinion,
investors
may
lose
confidence
in
the
accuracy
and
completeness
of
our
financial
reports,
we
may
face
restricted
access
to
the
capital\nmarkets
or
other
sources
of
funds
and
our
stock
price
may
be
adversely
affected.\nWe
also
previously
qualified
as
a
“smaller
reporting
company”
as
defined
in
the
Exchange
Act,
but
as
a
result
of
becoming
a
“large
accelerated
filer,”
we
will
no
longer
be\ndeemed
to
be
a
smaller
reporting
company.
However,
in
accordance
with
SEC
guidance,
we
are
still
able
to
take
advantage
of
scaled
disclosures
available
to
smaller
reporting\ncompanies
in
this
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K
for
the
year
ending
December
31,
2021
and
our
2022
proxy
statement.
These
scaled
disclosures
include
presenting
only
the
two\nmost
recent
fiscal
years
of
audited
financial
statements
in
our
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K
and
reduced
disclosure
obligations
regarding
executive
compensation.
This
may
make\ncomparison
of
our
disclosures
with
another
public
company,
which
is
not
a
smaller
reporting
company,
difficult
because
of
the
differences
in
the
extent
of
such
disclosure.\nITEM

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS\nThe
following
discussion
and
analysis
provides
information
that
our
management
believes
is
relevant
to
an
assessment
and
understanding
of
our
results
of
operations
and\nfinancial
condition.
This
discussion
and
analysis
should
be
read
in
conjunction
with
our
consolidated
financial
statements
and
the
related
notes
contained
elsewhere
in
this
Annual\nReport
on
Form
10-K.
As
discussed
in
Note
2
to
the
accompanying
consolidated
financial
statements,
the
Company
corrected
the
2020
consolidated
financial
statements
to
account\nfor
private
placement
warrants
as
a
liability
on
the
Company’s
consolidated
balance
sheet
with
subsequent
changes
in
their
value
recognized
in
the
Company’s
consolidated\nstatement
of
operations
at
each
reporting
date.
These
corrections
are
reflected
in
the
discussions.
The
statements
in
this
discussion
regarding
industry
trends,
our
expectations\nregarding
our
future
performance,
liquidity
and
capital
resources
and
other
non-historical
statements
are
forward-looking
statements.
These
forward-looking
statements
are\nsubject
to
numerous
risks
and
uncertainties,
including,
but
not
limited
to,
the
risks
and
uncertainties
described
in
Part
I,
Item
1A.
“Risk
Factors”
and
“Cautionary
Note
Regarding\nForward-Looking
Statements.”
Our
actual
results
may
differ
materially
from
those
contained
in
or
implied
by
any
forward-looking
statements.\nCertain
figures,
such
as
percentages,
included
in
this
section
have
been
rounded
for
ease
of
presentation.
Percentage
figures
included
in
this

have
not
in
all
cases\nbeen
calculated
on
the
basis
of
such
rounded
figures
but
on
the
basis
of
such
amounts
prior
to
rounding.
For
this
reason,
percentage
amounts
in
this

may
vary
slightly
from\nthose
obtained
by
performing
the
same
calculations
using
the
figures
in
our
financial
statements
or
in
the
associated
text.
Certain
other
amounts
that
appear
in
this
section
may\nsimilarly
not
sum
due
to
rounding.\nOverview\nCanoo
is
a
mobility
technology
company
with
a
mission
to
bring
electric
vehicles
(“EVs”)
to
everyone
and
provide
connected
services
that
improve
the
vehicle
ownership\nexperience.
We
are
developing
a
technology
platform
that
we
believe
will
enable
us
to
rapidly
innovate
and
bring
new
products,
addressing
multiple
use
cases,
to
market
faster
than\nour
competition
and
at
lower
cost.
Our
vehicle
architecture
and
design
philosophy
are
aimed
at
driving
productivity
and
returning
capital
to
our
customers,
and
we
believe
the\nsoftware
and
technology
capabilities
we
are
developing,
packaged
around
a
modular,
customizable
product,
have
the
potential
to
fundamentally
alter
the
value
proposition
across
a\nvehicle’s
lifecycle.
We
remain
committed
to
the
environment
and
to
delivering
sustainable
mobility
that
is
accessible
to
everyone.
We
proudly
intend
to
manufacture
our
fully\nelectric
vehicles
in
Arkansas
and
Oklahoma,
bringing
advanced
manufacturing
and
technology
jobs
to
communities
in
America's
heartland.
We
are
committed
to
building
a
diverse\nworkforce
that
will
draw
heavily
upon
the
local
communities
of
Native
Americans
and
veterans.\nWe
believe
we
are
one
of
the
first
automotive
manufacturers
focused
on
capturing
value
across
the
entirety
of
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.
Our
platform\nand
data
architecture
is
purpose-built
to
be
durable
and
serve
as
the
foundation
for
the
vehicles
we
intend
to
offer,
unlocking
a
highly
differentiated,
multi-layer
business
model.
The\nfoundational
layer
is
our
Multi-Purpose
Platform
(“MPP”
or
“platform”)
architecture,
which
serves
as
the
base
of
our
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
its
Delivery,\nBase,
Premium,
and
Adventure
trims;
the
Multi-Purpose
Delivery
Vehicle
(“MPDV”)
and
the
Pickup.
The
next
layer
is
cybersecurity
which
is
embedded
in
our
vehicle
to
ensure\nthe
privacy
and
protection
of
vehicle
data.
Our
top
hats,
or
cabins,
are
modular
and
purpose-built
to
provide
tailored
solutions
for
our
customers.
This
intentional
design
enables
us\nto
efficiently
use
resources
to
produce
only
what
is
necessary,
underscoring
our
focus
on
sustainability
and
returning
capital
to
customers.
The
remaining
layers,
connected\naccessories
and
digital
customer
ecosystem,
present
high-margin
opportunities
that
extend
beyond
the
initial
vehicle
sale,
across
multiple
owners.
Owners
will
further
be
able
to\ncustomize
their
vehicles
by
adding
connected
accessories
such
as
Bluetooth
devices
or
infotainment
systems.
In
addition,
there
are
opportunities
for
software
sales
throughout
the\nvehicle
life,
including
predictive
maintenance
and
service
software
or
advanced
driver
assistance
systems
(“ADAS”)
upgrades.\nOur
platform
architecture
is
a
self-contained,
fully
functional
rolling
chassis
that
directly
houses
the
most
critical
components
for
operation
of
an
EV,
including
our
in-\nhouse
designed
proprietary
electric
drivetrain,
battery
systems,
advanced
vehicle
control
electronics
and
software
and
other
critical
components,
which
all
have
been
optimized
for\nfunctional
integration.
Both
our
true
steer-by-wire
system,
believed
to
be
the
first
such
system
applied
to
a
production-intent
vehicle,
and
our
flat
composite
leaf-spring
suspension\nsystem
are
core
components
of
our
platform’s
differentiated
functionality,
enabling
the
development
of
a
broad
range
of
vehicle
types
and
use
cases
due
to
the
chassis’
flat
profile\nand
fully
variable
steering
positions.
All
of
our
announced
vehicles,
including
the
Lifestyle
Vehicle
and
the
Lifestyle
Delivery
Vehicle,
the
MPDV
and
the
Pickup,
will
share
a\ncommon
platform
architecture
paired
with
different
top
hats
to
create
a
range
of
uniquely
customized
and
use
case
optimized
purpose-built
mobility
solutions
targeting
multiple\nsegments
of
the
rapidly
expanding
EV
marketplace.\n60\n"",

Document(page_content='Table
of
Contents\nIn
addition
to
our
vehicle
technology,
we
are
developing
a
software
platform
that
aggregates
car
data
from
both
Canoo
and
non-Canoo
vehicles
and
delivers
valuable\ninsights
to
our
customers.
Collected
over-the-air
for
connected
vehicles
or
via
an
on-board

(“OBD”)

we
believe
car

is
critical
to\npowering
the
customer
journey
and
maximizing
utility
and

from
the
vehicle
ownership
experience.
Leveraging
our

we
aim
to
create
the

that
centralizes
all

and
provides
key

across

Through

we

we
can
provide
differentiated
value
to
both
commercial
customers\nand
consumers
by
staying
connected
throughout
the
vehicle
lifecycle,
across
multiple
owners.\nCore
to
our
ethos
is
delivering
high

while
empowering
local
communities,
which
drove
our
decision
to
build
in
America
and
source
a
majority
of
our\nparts
from
America
and
allied
nations.
We
believe
vertical
integration
across
our
manufacturing
and
assembly
process
will
enable
us
to
achieve
start
of
production
(“SOP”)
with\nless
supply
chain
risk
and
provide
us
better
oversight
of
our
vehicle
manufacturing.
We
are
building
production
facilities
in
states
and
communities
that
are
investing
in
high-tech\nmanufacturing
alongside
us,
creating
American
jobs
and
driving
innovation.
We
intend
to
have
an
advanced
industrialization
facility
in
Bentonville,
Arkansas
and
a
mega\nmicrofactory
in
Pryor,
Oklahoma.
We
also
plan
to
move
our
corporate
headquarters
to
Bentonville.
The
Bentonville
manufacturing
facility
will
be
a
low-volume
facility,
which
we\nintend
to
use
in
the
near-term
for
the
initial
production
of
our
vehicles,
allowing
us
to
test
and
validate
our
manufacturing
equipment
and
processes
before
large-scale
production\nbegins
in
our
mega
microfactory.
In
the
long
term,
we
expect
to
use
the
Bentonville
facility
for
rapidly
innovating
on
product
concepts.\nWe
have
made
strategic
investments
in
our
technology
and
products
that
position
us
to
capture
three
large
and
growing
markets
-
commercial
and
passenger
vehicles,\nupfitting
and
accessories,
and
car
data.
With
the
rise
of
on-demand
delivery
and
eCommerce,
it
is
increasingly
important
to
bring
electrification
to
commercial
vehicles,
which\nMordor
Intelligence
estimated
represented
a
market
opportunity
of
over
$715
billion
as
of
2020.
We
also
have
chosen
to
pursue
the
most
profitable
segments
of
the
passenger\nvehicle
market,
the
SUV
and
Pickup
segments,
which
IHS
estimates
to
have
generated
over
$115
billion
in
profits
in
2020.
In
addition
to
this
opportunity
in
commercial
and\npassenger
vehicle
markets,
due
to
the
modularity
and
customization
of
all
our
vehicles,
we
believe
there
is
a
significant
opportunity
in
upfitting
and
accessories
across
the
vehicle\nlifecycle,
which
the
Specialty
Equipment
Market
Association
(“SEMA”)
estimated
were
valued
at
$24
billion
in
2020.
Lastly,
according
to
research
conducted
by
McKinsey,
the\nvalue
from
car
data
monetization
is
expected
to
generate
an
over
$250
billion
market
by
2030.
Altogether,
we
estimate
our
highly
strategic
total
market
opportunity
could
grow
to\nbe
over
$1
trillion.\nSince
our
founding
in
2017,
we
continue
to
innovate
on
our
technology
and
strategy.
To
date,
we
have
achieved
critical
milestones
in
the
development,
testing,
and\nmanufacturing
of
our
platform
and
product,
as
well
as
important
developments
for
our
business:\n•\nTony
Aquila,
who
has
deep
expertise
in
vehicle

software,
became
CEO
in
April
2021
in
addition
to
being
Executive
Chair
of
the
Board
of
Directors;\nMr.
Aquila
is
also
our
largest

in
addition,
we
have
announced
the

We
continue
to
innovate
and
develop
every
aspect
of
our
business,
from
our
non-traditional
business
model
to
our
built
in
America,

across
these
areas
has
set
the
foundation
for
us
to
develop
into
a
scalable
business
that
is
differentiated
from
our
peers
across
the
automotive
original
equipment\nmanufacturer
(“OEM”)
landscape.\nBusiness
Combination
and
Public
Company
Costs\nOn
December
21,
2020,
we
consummated
the
Business
Combination.\nImmediately
prior
to
closing
of
the
Business
Combination,
all
Legacy
Canoo
preference
shares
that
were
issued
and
outstanding
were
automatically
converted
into
Legacy\nCanoo
ordinary
shares.
Upon
the
consummation
of
the
Business
Combination,
each
Legacy
Canoo
ordinary
share
issued
and
outstanding
was
canceled
and
converted
into
the
right\nto
receive
the
Per
Share
Merger
Consideration.\nUpon
the
closing
of
the
Business
Combination,
our
Certificate
of
Incorporation
was
amended
and
restated
to,
among
other
things,
increase
the
total
number
of
authorized\nshares
of
all
classes
of
capital
stock
to
510,000,000

of
which
500,000,000

and
of
which
10,000,000\nshares
were
designated
preferred

$0.0001
par
value
per
share.\nAs
part
of
becoming
a
public
company
in
December
2020,
we
have
implemented
procedures
and
processes
to
address
public
company
regulatory
requirements
and\ncustomary
practices.
We
have
incurred
and
expect
to
continue
to
incur
recurring
expenses
as
a
publicly
traded
company
for,
among
other
things,
costs
associated
with
the\nemployment
of
additional

compliance
under
the
Exchange

directors
and
officers
liability
insurance,
director
fees
and
additional
internal

and
administrative
resources,
including
increased
audit
and
legal
fees.\nCovid-19
Impact\nCOVID-19
and
actions
taken
to
mitigate
its
spread
have
had
and
are
expected
to
continue
to
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
economies
and
financial
markets
of
many\ncountries,
including
the
geographical
area
in
which
we
operate.\nAs
the
COVID-19
pandemic
continues
to
evolve,
the
ultimate
extent
of
the
impact
on
our
business,
operating
results,
cash
flows,
liquidity
and
financial
condition
will
be\nprimarily
driven
by
the
severity
and
duration
of
the
pandemic,
the
pandemic’s
further
impact
on
the
U.S.
and
global
economies
(including
on
supply
chain
and
inflation)
and
the\ntiming,
scope
and
effectiveness
of
federal,
state
and
local
governmental
responses
to
the
pandemic,
as
well
as
emergence
of
virus
variants.\nThe
measures
taken
by
governmental
authorities
and
otherwise
to
control
the
spread
of
the
virus
have
adversely
impacted
our
employees’
ability
to
collaborate
in
a\ndiscipline
that
requires
a
high
degree
of
collaborative
work.
Our
operations
have
had
to
change
and
adapt
to
meet
these
new
demands.
The
operations
of
our
suppliers,
vendors
and\nbusiness
partners
have
also
been
impacted.
Various
aspects
of
our
business
cannot
be
conducted
remotely,
including
the
testing
and
manufacturing
of
our
EVs.
Further,
as
a\ngrowing
company,
the
ability
for
us
to
hire,
onboard
and
train
new
employees
has
been
impacted
and
has
required
us
to
evaluate
areas
of
our
business
that
will
not
result
in
the
best\nuse
of
our
human
capital
for
long-term
growth.
The
spread
of
COVID-19
has
also
caused
us
and
many
of
our
contractors
and
service
providers
to
modify
business
practices\n(including
employee
travel,
recommending
that
all
non-essential
personnel
work
from
home
and
cancellation
or
reduction
of
physical
participation
in
testing
activities,
meetings,\nevents
and
conferences),
and
collectively
with
our
contractors
and
service
providers,
we
have
been
and
may
further
be
required
to
take
actions
as
required
by
government\nauthorities
or
that
we
determine
are
in
the
best
interests
of
our
employees,
customers,
suppliers,
vendors
and
business
partners.
There
is
no
certainty
that
such
actions
will
be\nsufficient
to
mitigate
the
risks
posed
by
the
virus
or
otherwise
be
satisfactory
to
government
authorities.
In
addition,
increased
demand
for
semiconductor
chips
in
2020,
due
in
part\nto
the
COVID-19
pandemic
and
increased
demand
for
consumer
electronics
that
use
these
chips,
has
resulted
in
a
global
shortage
of
chips
in
2021.
As
a
result,
our
ability
to
source\nsemiconductor
chips
used
in
our
vehicles
may
be
adversely
affected.
This
shortage
may
result
in
increased
chip
delivery
lead
times,
delays
in
the
production
of
our
vehicles,
and\nincreased
costs
to
source
available
semiconductor
chips.\nWith
the
expansion
of
vaccination
efforts
in
the
United
States
and
elsewhere,
a
majority
of
governmental
restrictions
have
loosened,
and
businesses
are
resuming
more\nnormal
operations.
However,
while
the
pandemic
continues,
if
significant
portions
of
our
workforce
or
contractors
and
service
providers
are
unable
to
work
effectively,
including\ndue
to
illness,
quarantines,
social
distancing,
government
actions
or
other
restrictions
in
connection
with
the
COVID-19
pandemic,
our
operations
will
be
impacted.
These
factors\nrelated
to
COVID-19
are
beyond
our
knowledge
and
control
and,
as
a
result,
at
this
time,
we
are
unable
to
predict
the
ultimate
impact,
both
in
terms
of
severity
and
duration,
that
the\nCOVID-19
pandemic
will
have
on
our
business,
operating
results,
cash
flows
and
financial
condition,
but
it
could
be
material
if
the
current
circumstances
continue
to
exist
for
a\nprolonged
period
of
time.

may
not

to
historical
results
as
a
result
of
the
Business
Combination,
which
was
completed\nlate
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
2020.\nKey
Factors
Affecting
Operating
Results\nWe
believe
that
our
performance
and
future
success
depend
on
several
factors
that
present
significant
opportunities
for
us
but
also
pose
risks
and
challenges,
including\nthose
discussed
below
and
in
Item
1A,
“Risk
Factors.”\nSuccessful
Development
of
our
Facilities
and
Commercialization
of
Our
EVs\nWe
expect
to
derive
future
revenue
from
our
first
vehicle
offerings,
which
are
not
expected
to
launch
until
2022
or
after.
In
order
to
reach
commercialization,
we
must\ndevelop
and
tool
our
facilities
and
purchase
and
integrate
related
property
and
equipment,
as
well
as
achieve
several
research
and
development
milestones.
We
may
not
be
able
to\nsuccessfully
develop
our
facilities
or
commercialize
our
EVs.\nWe
expect
that
both
our
capital
and
operating
expenditures
will
increase
significantly
in
connection
with
our
ongoing
activities,
as
we:\n•\ncommercialize
our
EVs;\n•\ninvest
in
manufacturing
capacity,
via
both
our
own
owned
facilities;\n•\ncontinue
to
invest
in
our
technology,
research
and
development
efforts;\n•\nincrease
our
investment
in
marketing,
advertising,
sales
and
distribution
infrastructure
for
our
EVs
and
services;\n•\nobtain,
maintain
and
improve
our
operational,
financial
and
management
information
systems;\n•\nhire
additional
personnel;\n•\nobtain,
maintain,
expand
and
protect
our
intellectual
property
portfolio;
and\n•\ncontinue
to
operate
as
a
public
company.\nAs
a
result,
we
will
require
substantial
additional
capital
to
develop
our
EVs
and
services
and
fund
our
operations
for
the
foreseeable
future.
We
will
also
require
capital
to\nidentify
and
commit
resources
to
investigate
new
areas
of
demand.
Until
we
can
generate
sufficient
revenue
from
vehicle
sales,
we
expect
to
primarily
finance
our
operations\nthrough
commercialization
and
production
with
proceeds
from
the
Business
Combination,
including
the
proceeds
from
the
PIPE
Financing
that
took
place
concurrently
with
the\nBusiness
Combination,
and,
as
needed,
secondary
public
offerings
or
debt
financings.
The
amount
and
timing
of
our
future
funding
requirements,
will
depend
on
many
factors,\nincluding
the
pace
and
results
of
our
research
and
development
efforts
and
our
ability
to
successfully
manage
and
control
costs.\nKey

2020,
our
revenue
was
derived
from
the
provision
of
engineering,
development
and
design
consulting
services
on
a
project
basis.
No
revenue
was
generated
during\n2021.
Once
we
reach
commercialization
and
commence
production
of
our

we
expect
that
the
majority
of
our
revenue
will
be
derived
initially
from
sales
of
our
vehicles
and\ncommercial
products
and

of
Revenue,
excluding
Depreciation\nDuring

excluding
depreciation
for
the
consulting
services
rendered
in
relation
to
engineering,
development
and
design
services\nprovided
on
a

basis.
No
cost
of

Once
we
reach
commercialization
and
commence
production
of
our

we
expect
cost
of

parts,
including
batteries,
and
direct
labor
costs.\nResearch
and
Development
Expenses,
excluding

stock-based\ncompensation,
as
well
as
materials
and

and
Cost
of
Revenue,
excluding
Depreciation\nWe
did
not
generate
any
revenue
in
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021
since
the
Company
is
an
early
stage
growth
company
in
the
pre-commercialization
stage
of\ndevelopment.\nRevenue
was
$2.6
million
in
the
year
ended
December
31,
2020.
Revenue
in
2020
was
generated
from
the
provision
of
engineering,
development
and
design
consulting\nservices
on
a
project
basis.
Cost
of
revenue,
excluding
depreciation
expense,
was
$0.7
million
in
the
year
ended
December
31,
2020.
The
cost
of
revenue,
excluding
depreciation
for\nyear
ended
December
31,
2020
includes
materials,
labor,
and
other
direct
costs
related
to
the
provision
of
engineering,
development,
and
design
consulting
services.\nResearch
and
Development
Expenses,
excluding
Depreciation\nResearch
and
development
expenses
increased
by
$103.4
million,
or
72.4%,
to
$246.2
million
in
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
compared
to
$142.9
million
in
the\nyear
ended
December
31,
2020.
The
increase
was
primarily
due
to
increases
in
research
and
development
costs
of
$92.5
million
and
salary
and
related
benefits
expense
of
$38.8\nmillion,
partially
offset
by
a
decrease
in
stock-based
compensation
expense
of
$33.6
million.
The
increase
in
research
and
development
costs
primarily
is
related
to
expenditures
for\nthe
Gamma
stage
engineering
design
and
development
costs
incurred
during
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021.\nSalary

increased
$38.8
million,
from
$48.2

year
ended
December
31,
2020
to
$87.0
million
during
the
year
ended\nDecember
31,
2021.
These
increases
are
primarily
due
to
continued
investment
in

and

employees
to
drive
and
reach
our
research
and
development
goals.\n(1)\n(1)\n65\n',

Document(page_content=""Table
of
Contents\nThe
decrease
in
stock-based

million
was
primarily
driven
by
the
restricted

issued
during
the
year

2020.
This
decrease
was
largely
due

to
support
our
growth
and

related
to
the

Vehicle,
Multi-Purpose\nDelivery
Vehicles,

which
are
expected
to
launch
as
early
as
2022
and
2023.\nSelling,
General
and
Administrative
Expenses,
excluding
Depreciation\nSelling,
general
and
administrative
expenses
increased
by
$143.1
million,
or
277.3%,
to
$194.7
million
in
the

2021,
compared
to
$51.6
million
in\nthe
year
ended
December
31,
2020.
The
increase
was
primarily
due
to
increases
of
$57.7
million
in
stock-based
compensation
expenses,
$41.3
million
in
professional
fees,
$17.2\nmillion
in

in
occupancy
costs,
and
$6.1
million
in
marketing
and

Other
factors
affecting
selling,
general
and
administrative\nexpenses
were
individually
immaterial.\nThe
increase
in
stock-based
compensation
expenses
of
$57.7
million
was
primarily
driven
by
certain
awards
granted
during
the
year
ended

2021
subject
to\ntime,
performance
and
market
vesting
conditions,
primarily
in
the
form
of
restricted
and
performance
stock
units.
The
remaining
increase
was
primarily
driven
by
the
continued\nrecognition
of
stock
compensation
expense,
resulting
from
the
modification
of
certain
performance
restricted
stock
awards
to
become

were
individually

increased
by
$41.3
million
to
$48.1
million
in
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
compared
to
$6.8
million
in
the
year
ended
December
31,
2020.
The\nincrease
was
primarily
due
to
activities
related
to
the
Company’s
business
development,
legal
fees,
and
consulting
fees.\nSalary
and
related
benefits
expenses
increased
$17.2

in
the
year
ended
December

2021,
compared
to
$12.3

These\nincreases
were
due
primarily
to
investment
in
personnel
to
support
our
growth
and
achieve
start
of
production
in

2022.\nWe

to
continue

its
variants.\nInterest
Expense\nInterest
expense
decreased
by
$10.6
million
in
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021.
The
decrease
was
primarily
due
to
interest

Financial
Measures\nIn
addition
to

results
determined
in
accordance
with
GAAP,
we
believe
the
following
non-GAAP
measures
are
useful
in
evaluating
our
operational
performance.
We\nuse
the
following
non-GAAP
measures
to
evaluate
our
ongoing
operations
and
for
internal
planning
and
forecasting
purposes.
We
believe
that
non-GAAP
financial
information,\nwhen
taken
collectively,
may
be
helpful
to
investors
in
assessing
our
operating
performance.\nEBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA\n“EBITDA”
is
defined
as
net
loss
before
interest
expense,
income
tax
expense
or
benefit,
and
depreciation
and
amortization.
“Adjusted
EBITDA”
is
defined
as
EBITDA\nadjusted
for
stock-based
compensation,
restructuring
charges,
asset
impairments,
and
other
costs
associated
with
exit
and
disposal
activities,
acquisition
and
related
costs,
changes
to\nthe
fair
value
of
contingent
earnout
shares
liability,
changes
to
the
fair
value
of
warrants
liability,
and
any
other
one-time
non-recurring
transaction
amounts
impacting
the
statement\nof
operations
during
the
year.
Adjusted
EBITDA
is
intended
as
a
supplemental
measure
of
our
performance
that
is
neither
required
by,
nor
presented
in
accordance
with,
GAAP.\nWe
believe
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA,
when
combined
with
net
loss
are
beneficial
to
an
investor’s
complete
understanding
of
our
operating
performance.
We
believe
that
the\nuse
of
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
provides
an
additional
tool
for
investors
to
use
in
evaluating
ongoing
operating
results
and
trends
and
in
comparing
our
financial
measures\nwith
those
of
comparable
companies,
which
may
present
similar
non-GAAP
financial
measures
to
investors.
However,
you
should
be
aware
that
when
evaluating
EBITDA
and\nAdjusted
EBITDA
we
may
incur
future
expenses
similar
to
those
excluded
when
calculating
these
measures.
In
addition,
our
presentation
of
these
measures
should
not
be\nconstrued
as
an
inference
that
our
future
results
will
be
unaffected
by
unusual
or
non-recurring
items.
Our
computation
of
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
may
not
be
comparable\nto
other
similarly
titled
measures
computed
by
other
companies,
because
all
companies
may
not
calculate
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
in
the
same
fashion.\nBecause
of
these
limitations,
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
should
not
be
considered
in
isolation
or
as
a
substitute
for
performance
measures
calculated
in
accordance\nwith
GAAP.
We
manage
our
business
utilizing
EBITDA
and
Adjusted
EBITDA
as
supplemental
performance
measures.\n67\n',

accompanying
financial
statements.\nAs
an
early
stage
growth
company
in
the
pre-commercialization
stage
of
development,
since
inception
the
Company
has
incurred
negative
cash
flows
from
operating\nactivities
of
$300.8
million
and
$107.1
million
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
2021
and
2020,
respectively,
which
are
consistent
with
our
strategy
and
budget.
We
expect
to\ncontinue
to
incur
net
losses,
comprehensive
losses,
and
negative
cash
flows
from
operating
activities
in
accordance
with
our
operating
plan
as
we
continue
to
expand
our
research\nand
development
activities
to
complete
the
development
of
our
EVs,
establish
our
go-to-market
model
and
scale
our
operations
to
meet
anticipated
demand.
We
expect
that
both\nour
capital
and
operating
expenditures
will
increase
significantly
in
connection
with
our
ongoing
activities,
as
we:\n•\ncommercialize
our
EVs;\n•\ncontinue
to
invest
in
our
technology,
research
and
development
efforts;\n•\nincrease
our
investment
in
marketing,

for
our

and

maintain
and
improve
our

additional
personnel;\n•\nobtain,
maintain,
expand
and
protect
our
intellectual

portfolio;
and\n•\noperate
as
a
public
company.\nAs
an
early
stage
growth
company
adjusting
to
the
long-term
implications
of
the
COVID-19

our
ability
to

is
critical.

Sheet
Arrangements\nWe
are
not
a
party
to
any
off-balance
sheet
arrangements.\nCritical
Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates\nOur
financial
statements
have
been
prepared
in
accordance
with
GAAP.
The
preparation
of
these
financial
statements
requires
us
to
make
estimates
and
assumptions
that\naffect
the
reported
amounts
of
assets
and
liabilities
and
the
disclosure
of
contingent
assets
and
liabilities
as
of
the
date
of
the
financial
statements,
as
well
as
the
reported
expenses\nincurred
during
the
reporting
periods.
Our
estimates
are
based
on
our
historical
experience
and
on
various
other
factors
that
we
believe
are
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
the\nresults
of
which
form
the
basis
for
making
judgments
about
the
carrying
value
of
assets
and
liabilities
that
are
not
readily
apparent
from
other
sources.\nActual
results
may
differ
from
these
estimates
under
different
assumptions
or
conditions.
We
believe
that
the
accounting
policies
discussed
below
are
critical
to\nunderstanding
our
historical
and
future
performance,
as
these
policies
relate
to
the
more
significant
areas
involving
management’s
judgments
and
estimates.\nWhile
our
significant
accounting
policies
are
described
in
Note
2,
Basis
of
Presentation
and
Summary
of
Significant
Accounting
Policies,
of
the
notes
to
the
consolidated\nfinancial
statements
included
elsewhere
in
this
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K,
we
believe
that
the
following
accounting
policies
require
a
greater
degree
of
judgment
and
complexity\nand
are
the
most
critical
to
understanding
our
financial
condition
and
historical
and
future
results
of
operations:\nContingent
Earnout
Shares
Liability\nAs
part
of
the
Business
Combination,
certain
stockholders
and
employees
are
entitled
to
receive
Earnout
Shares
to
be
issued
when
our
Common
Stock’s
price
reaches\ncertain
market
share
price
milestones
within
specified
periods
following
the
Business
Combination
on
December
21,
2020.
The
terms
and
conditions
of
the
right
to
receive
Earnout\nShares
are
described
in
Note
13
to
the
accompanying
consolidated
financial
statements.
In
accordance
with
the
guidance
under
ASC
815,
Derivatives
and
Hedging,
the
Earnout\nShares
right
was
classified
as
a
Level
3
fair
value
measurement
liability,
and
the
increase
or
decrease
in
the
fair
value
during
the
reporting
period
is
recognized
as
other
expense
or\nother
income
in
our
consolidated
statement
of
operations
accordingly.
The
fair
value
of
the
contingent
Earnout
Shares
liability
was
estimated
using
a
Monte
Carlo
simulation
of\nstock
prices
based
on
a
volatility
rate
determined
from
a
peer
group
of
public
companies
and
in
consideration
of
other
valuation-based
inputs.
Changes
in
these
inputs
or
other\nunderlying
assumptions
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
fair
value
of
the
contingent
earnout
shares
liability.
Changes
to
contingent
earnout
shares
liability
can
result
from\nchanges
to
discount
rates
or
accretion
of
the
liability
due
to
the
passage
of
time.
The
determination
of
the
contingent
earnout
shares
liability
requires
significant
judgments
including\nthe
appropriateness
of
the
valuation
model,
reasonableness
of
estimates
and
assumptions,
and
the
discount
rates
applied
to
such
forecasts.\nAs
of
December
21,
2020,
the
initial
fair
value
of
our
contingent
Earnout
Shares
liability
was
recognized
at
$248.9
million
with
a
corresponding
reduction
from
the\nadditional
paid
in
capital
in
our
stockholders’
equity.
As
of
December
31,
2020,
the
fair
value
of
our
contingent
Earnout
Shares
liability
was
estimated
to
be
$133.5
million.
We\nrecognized
a
gain
on
fair
value
change
in
contingent
Earnout
Shares
liability
of
$115.4
million
as
other
income
in
our
consolidated
statement
of
operations
for
the
year

in

Earnout

of
$104.4
million
as
other
income
in
our\nconsolidated
statement
of
operations
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021.\nStock-Based
Compensation\nWe
account
for
stock-based
compensation
awards
granted
to
employees
and
members
of
our
Board
based
on
the
awards’
estimated
grant
date
fair
value
using
a
fair
value\nmethod.
For
awards
that
vest
solely
based
on
continued
service
(“requisite
service”),
the
resulting
fair
value
is
recognized
as
an
expense
on
an
accelerated
basis
over
the
requisite\nservice
period,
which
is
generally
four
years.
For
awards
which
contain
performance
conditions,
the
resulting
fair
value
is
recognized
over
the
requisite
service
period
using
the\ngraded
vesting
method,
when
it
is
probable
the
performance
conditions
will
be
met.
We
account
for
forfeitures
as
they
occur.\nPrior
to
consummation
of
the
Business
Combination
in
December
2020,
the
fair
value
of
our
restricted
stock
units
(RSUs)
was
based
on
the
fair
value
of
the
Legacy
Canoo\nordinary
shares
on
the
date
of
grant.
As
there
is
no
public
market
for
the
Legacy
Canoo
ordinary
shares,
the
Legacy
Canoo
board
of
directors,
with
the
assistance
of
a
third-party\nvaluation
specialist,
determined
the
fair
value
of
the
Legacy
Canoo
ordinary
shares
at
the
time
of
the
grant
of
RSUs
by
considering
a
number
of
objective
and
subjective
factors,\nincluding
the
Legacy
Canoo’s
actual
operating
and
financial
performance,
market
conditions
and
performance
of
comparable
publicly-traded
companies,
development
milestones\nfor
the
Legacy
Canoo,
the
likelihood
of
achieving
a
liquidity
event
and
transactions
involving
the
Legacy
Canoo’s
ordinary
shares,
among
other
factors.
The
fair
value
of
the
Legacy\nCanoo
ordinary
shares
was
derived
from
the
Legacy
Canoo
total
equity
value
divided
by
the
number
of
Legacy
Canoo
ordinary
shares
outstanding
and
was
estimated
using
a\nprobability-weighted
expected
return
model,
using
different
probability
weightings
estimated
for
public
offering
scenario,
mergers
and
acquisitions
(“M&A”)
scenario
and\ndissolution
scenario.
The
factors
and
scenario
weighting
estimates
require
significant
judgment
and
involve
inherent
uncertainties,
which
can
materially
affect
the
estimate
of
the\nfair
value
of
our
RSUs
and
ultimately
how
much
stock-based
compensation
expense
is
recognized.\nFollowing
the
completion
of
the
Business
Combination
in
December
2020,
we
estimate
the
fair
value
of
RSUs
based
on
the
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock
underlying\nthe
awards
on
the
grant
date.
Fair
value
for
awards
with
our
stock
price
performance
metrics
is
calculated
using
the
Monte
Carlo
simulation
model,
which
incorporates
stock
price\ncorrelation
and
other
variables
over
the
time
horizons
matching
the
performance
periods.\nThe
assumptions
underlying
these
valuations
represent
management’s
best
estimates,
which
involve
inherent
uncertainties
and
the
application
of
management
judgment.\nAs
a
result,
if
factors
or
expected
outcomes
change
and
our
management
uses
significantly
different
assumptions
or
estimates,
our
stock-based
compensation
expense
for
future\nperiods
could
be
materially
different,
including
as
a
result
of
adjustments
to
stock-based
compensation
expense
recorded
for
prior
periods.\nFor
the
years
ended
December
31,
2021
and
2020
total
stock-based
compensation
expense
was
$108.4

held
by
non-affiliates
as
of
June

of

on

Therefore,
our

to
Section
404(b)

Act
in
this

addition,
as
a
result
of
becoming
a
“large

we
no
longer
qualify
to
be

even
though
our
annual
revenue
is
less
than
$100.0\nmillion

the
year
ended

As
a
result,
starting
with
our
first

in
2022,
we
will
no
longer
be
eligible
to
rely
on
the

In

audited,

for
Opinion\nThese
financial
statements
are
the
responsibility
of
the
Company\'s
management.
Our
responsibility
is
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
Company\'s
financial
statements
based
on
our\naudits.
We
are
a
public
accounting
firm
registered
with
the
PCAOB
and
are
required
to
be
independent
with
respect
to
the
Company
in
accordance
with
the
U.S.
federal
securities\nlaws
and
the
applicable
rules
and
regulations
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
and
the
PCAOB.\nWe
conducted
our
audits
in
accordance
with
the
standards
of
the
PCAOB.
Those
standards
require
that
we
plan
and
perform
the
audit
to
obtain
reasonable
assurance
about
whether\nthe
financial
statements
are
free
of
material
misstatement,
whether
due
to
error
or
fraud.
Our
audits
included
performing
procedures
to
assess
the
risks
of
material
misstatement
of\nthe
financial
statements,
whether
due
to
error
or
fraud,
and
performing
procedures
that
respond
to
those
risks.
Such
procedures
included
examining,
on
a
test
basis,
evidence\nregarding
the
amounts
and
disclosures
in
the
financial
statements.
Our
audits
also
included
evaluating
the
accounting
principles
used
and
significant
estimates
made
by
management,\nas
well
as
evaluating
the
overall
presentation
of
the
financial
statements.
We
believe
that
our
audits
provide
a
reasonable
basis
for
our
opinion.\nCritical
Audit
Matter\nThe
critical
audit
matter
communicated
below
is
a
matter
arising
from
the
current-period
audit
of
the
financial
statements
that
was
communicated

Audit
Matter
Description\nThe
Company’s
acquisition
of
Canoo
Holdings
Ltd.,
which
was
consummated
during
the
year
ended
December
31,
2020
and
was
accounted
for
as
a
reverse
merger,
provided\ncertain
stockholders
and
employees
with
the
contingent
right
to
up
to
an
additional
15.0
million
shares
of
the
Company’s
common
stock
if
certain
conditions
are
met.\nThe
contingent
earnout
shares
are
accounted
for
as
a
liability
and
are
recorded
at
fair
value
each
period
end,
with
the
change
in
fair
value
recognized
as
other
expense
or
other\nincome
in
the
consolidated
statement
of
operations
during
the
period.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
liability
was
approximately
$29.1
million,
which
resulted
in
a
change
in
fair\nvalue
recognized
as
other
income
of
approximately
$104.4
million
during
the
year.
The
Company
used
a
Monte
Carlo
simulation
to
estimate
the
fair
value
of
the
contingent
earnout\nshares
liability
at
December
31,
2021.\nWe
identified
management’s
determination
of
the
fair
value
of
the
earnout
share
liability
as
a
critical
audit
matter
due
to
the
significant
judgments
made
by
management
to
estimate\nthe
fair
value
of
the
contingent
earnout
shares
liability,
including
the
selection
of
a
volatility
rate
derived
from
a
peer
group
of
public
companies,
and
in
consideration
of
the\ncomplexity
inherent
in
performing
a
Monte
Carlo
simulation.
Auditing
management’s
assumptions
related
to
the
selection
of
an
appropriate
volatility
rate
and
evaluating
the\nacceptability
of
the
results
of
management’s
Monte
Carlo
simulation
were
especially
challenging
and
required
a
high
degree
of
auditor
judgment,
including
the
involvement
of
our\nfair
value
specialists.\n74\n',

TO
THE
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS\nYears
Ended
December
31,
2021
and
2020\n1.
Organization
and
Business\nCanoo
Inc.
(“Canoo”
or
the
“Company”)
is
a
mobility
technology
company
with
a
mission
to
bring
EVs
to
everyone.
We
have
developed
a
breakthrough
EV
platform
that\nwe
believe
will
enable
us
to
rapidly
innovate,
and
bring
new
products
addressing
multiple
use
cases
to
market
faster
than
our
competition
and
at
lower
cost.\nBusiness
Combination\nOn
December
21,
2020
(the
“Closing
Date”),
Hennessy
Capital
Acquisition
Corp.
IV
(“HCAC”)
consummated
the
previously
announced
merger
pursuant
to
that
certain\nMerger
Agreement
and
Plan
of
Reorganization,
dated
August
17,
2020
(the
“Merger
Agreement”),
by
and
among
HCAC,
HCAC
IV
First
Merger
Sub,
Ltd.,
an
exempted
company\nincorporated
with
limited
liability
in
the
Cayman
Islands
and
a
direct,
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
HCAC
(“First
Merger
Sub”),
EV
Global
Holdco
LLC
(f/k/a
HCAC
IV
Second\nMerger
Sub,
LLC),
a
Delaware
limited
liability
company
and
a
direct,
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
HCAC
(“Second
Merger
Sub”),
and
Canoo
Holdings
Ltd.,
an
exempted\ncompany
incorporated
with
limited
liability
in
the
Cayman
Islands
(“Legacy
Canoo”).
Pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
Merger
Agreement,
a
business
combination
between
HCAC
and\nLegacy
Canoo
was
effected
through
the
merger
of
(a)
First
Merger
Sub
with
and
into
Legacy
Canoo,
with
Legacy
Canoo
surviving
as
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
HCAC
(Legacy\nCanoo,
in
its
capacity
as
the
surviving
corporation
of
the
merger,
the
“Surviving
Corporation”)
and
(b)
the
Surviving
Corporation
with
and
into
Second
Merger
Sub,
with
Second\nMerger
Sub
being
the
surviving
entity,
which
ultimately
resulted
in
Legacy
Canoo
becoming
a
wholly-owned
direct
subsidiary
of
HCAC
(all
transactions
collectively,
the
“Business\nCombination”).\nOn
the
Closing
Date,
and
in
connection
with
the
closing
of
the
Business
Combination,
HCAC
changed
its
name
to
Canoo
Inc.
and
the
Company’s
common
stock\n(“Common
Stock”)
began
trading
on
The
Nasdaq
Global
Select
Market
under
the
ticker
symbol
GOEV.
For
more
information
on
this
transaction
see
Note
4.\nLegacy
Canoo
was
deemed
to
be
the
accounting
acquirer
in
the
Business
Combination
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
criteria
outlined
in
Accounting
Standards
Codification\n(“ASC”)
805,
Business
Combinations.
While
HCAC
was
the
legal
acquirer
in
the
Business
Combination,
because
Legacy
Canoo
was
deemed
the
accounting
acquirer,
for
accounting\npurposes,
the
transaction
was
treated
as
a
recapitalization
of
Legacy
Canoo
(i.e.,
a
capital
transaction
involving
the
issuance
of
stock
by
HCAC
for
the
stock
of
Legacy
Canoo).\nAccordingly,
the
consolidated
assets,
liabilities
and
results
of
operations
of
Legacy
Canoo
became
the
historical
financial
statements
of
the
combined
company,
and
HCAC’s
assets,\nliabilities
and
results
of
operations
were
consolidated
with
Legacy
Canoo,
upon
the
consummation
of
the
Business
Combination.
The
net
assets
of
HCAC
are
recognized
at
historical\ncost
(which
is
expected
to
be
consistent
with
carrying
value),
with
no
goodwill
or
other
intangible
assets
recorded.\nRecent
Developments\nOn
June
16,
2021,
the
Company
and
VDL
Nedcar
B.V.
(“VDL
Nedcar”)
entered
into
a
binding
term
sheet
for
vehicle
contract
manufacturing
(the
“Term
Sheet”).
On
July\n1,
2021,
the
Company
made
a
$30.4
million
prepayment
to
VDL
Nedcar
pursuant
to
the
Term
Sheet,
which
was
classified
as
an
investing
outflow
in
the
accompanying\nconsolidated
statement
of
cash
flows.
As
of
September
30,
2021,
VDL
Nedcar
utilized
$4.3
million
of
the
prepayment
to
purchase
property
and
equipment
on
behalf
of
the\nCompany.
The
remaining
$26.1
million
was
classified
as
a
long-term
asset
in
Other
Assets
as
of
September
30,
2021.
On
December
15,
2021,
the
Company
and
VDL
Nedcar\nissued
a
joint
press
release
announcing
that
they
ceased
discussions
with
respect
to
the
Term
Sheet.
Upon
termination
of
the
Term
Sheet,
the
Company
had
a
right
to
a
refund
of
the\nentire
$30.4
million
prepayment.
As
such,
the
$30.4
million
prepayment
is
presented
as
a
receivable
in
the
accompanying
consolidated
balance
sheet
as
of
December
31,
2021.\nOn
October
19,
2021,
the
Company
entered
into
an
agreement
effective
October
15,
2021,
with
Panasonic
Industrial
Devices
Sales
Company
of
America,
a
Division
of\nPanasonic
Corporation
of
America
(“PIDSA”)
and
Sanyo
Electric
Co.
Ltd.,
acting
through
its
Mobility
Energy
Business
Division
(“SANYO”,
and
together
with
PIDSA,\n“Panasonic”)
for
the
supply
of
lithium-ion
battery
cells
(the
""Panasonic
Agreement"").
The
agreement
stipulates
an
upfront
non-refundable
$30.0
million
payment
payable
in\ntranches
through
March
2022
and
provides
for
cancellable
purchases
by
the
Company
during
an
initial
purchase
period
from
August
2022
through
December
2023.

of
the
Statement,
management
determined
that
the
Company’s
private
placement
warrants
issued
in
connection
with
HCAC's
IPO
on
March
5,
2019
do
not\nmeet
the
scope
exception
from
derivative
accounting
prescribed
by
ASC
815-40,
Contracts
in
Entity’s
Own
Equity.
Accordingly,
the
private
placement
warrants
should
have
been\nrecognized
by
the
Company
at
fair
value
as
of
the
Closing
Date
and
classified
as
a
liability,
rather
than
equity
in
the
Company’s
previously
reported
consolidated
balance
sheet
as\nof
December
31,
2020.
Thereafter,
the
change
in
fair
value
of
the
outstanding
private
placement
warrants
should
have
been
recognized
as
a
gain
(loss)
within
other
(expense)\nincome
each
reporting
period
in
the
Company’s
consolidated
statement
of
operations.
The
fair
value
of
the
private
placement
warrants
as
of
the
Closing
Date
on
December
21,
2020\nand
December
31,
2020
amounted
to
$9.7
million
and
$6.6
million,
respectively.
The
change
in
fair
value
from
the
Closing
Date
through
December
31,
2020
amounted
to
a
gain
of\n$3.1
million.\nThe
impact
of
the
misstatement
as
of
December
31,
2020
resulted
in
an
understatement
of
the
private
placement
warrants
liability
of
$6.6
million,
and
an
overstatement
of\naccumulated
deficit
and
additional
paid-in
capital
of
$3.1
million
and
$9.7
million
respectively.\nAccordingly,
management
is
correcting
the
relevant
financial
statements
and
related
footnotes
as
of
December
31,
2020
within
these
consolidated
financial
statements.\nManagement
has
evaluated
the
materiality
of
these
misstatements
based
on
an
analysis
of
quantitative
and
qualitative
factors
and
concluded
they
were
not
material
to
the
prior\nperiod
financial
statements,
individually
or
in
aggregate.\nThe
following

the

of

that
both
capital
and
operating
expenditures
will
increase
significantly
in
connection
with
its
ongoing
activities.
As
an
early-stage
growth
company,
the\nCompany’s
ability
to
access
capital
is
critical.
Management
plans
to
raise
additional
capital
through
a
combination
of
debt
financing,
other
non-dilutive
financing
and/or
equity\nfinancing.
To
the
extent
the
Company
is
unsuccessful
at
doing
so,
management
has
the
intent
and
ability
to
use
its
discretion
to
delay,
scale
back,
or
abandon
future
expenditures.\nThe
consolidated
financial
statements
include
the
results
of
Canoo
Inc.
and
its
subsidiaries.
Our
comprehensive
loss
is
the
same
as
our
net
loss.
All
intercompany\ntransactions
and
balances
have
been
eliminated
in
the
consolidation.\nCOVID-19\nBeginning
in
the
first
quarter
of
2021,
there
has
been
increasing
availability
and
administration
of
vaccines
against
COVID-19
in
many
parts
of
the
world,
as
well
as
an\neasing
of
restrictions
on
social,
business,
travel
and
government
activities
and
functions.
On
the
other
hand,
virus
variants,
infection
rates
and
regulations
continue
to
fluctuate
in\nvarious
regions
and
there
are
ongoing
global
impacts
resulting
from
the
pandemic,
including
challenges
and
increases
in
costs
for
logistics
and
supply
chains
and
intermittent\nsupplier
delays.
The
Company
has
also
previously
been
affected
by
temporary
facility
closures,
employment
and
compensation
adjustments,
and
impediments
to
administrative\nactivities
supporting
its
product
research
and
development.\nUltimately,
the
Company
cannot
predict
the
duration
or
severity
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
or
any
variant
thereof.
The
Company
will
continue
to
monitor
macroeconomic\nconditions
to
remain
flexible
and
to
optimize
and
evolve
its
business
as
appropriate.
To
do
this,
the
Company
plans
to
project
demand
and
infrastructure
requirements
globally
and\nto
deploy
its
workforce
and
other
resources
accordingly.\nSegment

Geographic
Information\nOur
principal

Company’s
property
and
equipment
and
right
of
use
assets
are
located
primarily
in
the
United
States
of
America.\nUse
of
Estimates\nThe
preparation
of
financial
statements
in
conformity
with
GAAP
requires
management
to
make
estimates
and
assumptions
that
affect
the
reported
amounts
of
assets
and\nliabilities
and
disclosure
of
contingent
assets
and
liabilities
at
the
date
of
the
consolidated
financial
statements
and
the
reported
amounts
of
revenue
and
expenses
during
the\nreporting
period.
Actual
results
could
differ
from
those
estimates.
Estimates
are
periodically
reviewed
in
light
of
changes
in
circumstances,
facts
and
experience.
Changes
in\nestimates
are
recorded
in
the
period
in
which
they
become
known.\nOn
an
ongoing
basis,
management
evaluates
its
estimates,
including
those
related
to
i)
useful
lives
of
property
and
equipment;
ii)
the
realization
of
deferred
tax
assets
and\nestimates
of
tax
reserves;
iii)
the
valuation
of
equity
securities
and
stock-based
compensation;
iv)
the
recognition
and
disclosure
of
contingent
liabilities;
and
v)
the
fair
value
of\nfinancial
instruments.
These
estimates
are
based
on
historical
data
and
experience,
as
well
as
various
other
factors
that
management
believes
to
be
reasonable
under
the\ncircumstances,
the
results
of
which
form
the
basis
for
making
judgments
about
the
carrying
value
of
assets
and
liabilities
that
are
not
readily
apparent
from
other
sources.
The\nCompany
may
engage
third
party
valuation
specialists
to
assist
with
estimates
related
to
the
valuation
of
the
underlying
value
of
its
assets,
liabilities
and
equity.
Such
estimates\noften
require
the
selection
of
appropriate
valuation
methodologies
and
models,
and
significant
judgment
in
evaluating
ranges
of
assumptions
and
financial
inputs.\nCash
and
Cash
Equivalents\nCash
and
cash
equivalents
consist
of
investments
that
are
highly
liquid,
readily
convertible
to
cash
and
which
have
an
original
maturity
date
within
three
months
from
the\ndate
of
purchase
as
well
as
savings,
checking
and
other
bank
accounts.\n85\n',

Leases
(“ASC
842”),
on
a
modified
retrospective
basis
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
of
adoption.
The\nCompany
determines
if
an
arrangement
is
a
lease
at
inception
if
the
Company
concludes
that
the
contract
is
in
the
scope
of
ASC
842
and
the
Company
has
the
right
to
control
the\nidentified
asset.
Operating
leases
are
included
in
operating
lease
right-of-use
(“ROU”)
assets,
and
operating
lease
liabilities
are
included
in
accrued
expenses
and
operating
lease\nliabilities
in
the
consolidated
balance
sheet.\nThe
operating
lease
ROU
assets
represent
the
Company’s
right
to
use
an
underlying
asset
for
the
lease
term
and
lease
liabilities
represent
the
Company’s
obligation
to\nmake
lease
payments
arising
from
the
lease.
The
operating
lease
ROU
assets
and
operating
lease
liabilities
are
recognized
at
the
lease
commencement
date
based
on
the
present\nvalue
of
lease
payments
over
the
lease
term.
As
the
Company’s
leases
do
not
provide
an
implicit
rate,
the
Company
estimates
an
incremental
borrowing
rate
based
on
the
estimated\nmarket
rate
of
interest
for
a
collateralized
borrowing
over
a
similar
term
of
the
lease
payments
at
commencement
date.
The
operating
lease
right-of-use
asset
also
includes
any
lease\npayments
made
prior
to
the
lease
commencement
date.
Lease
expense
for
operating
leases
is
recognized
on
a
straight-line
basis
over
the
lease
term.
The
determination
of
the
lease\nterm
includes
options
to
extend
or
terminate
the
lease
when
it
is
reasonably
certain
that
the
Company
will
exercise
that
option.\nThe
Company
has
elected
to
exclude
short-term
leases
(i.e.,
leases
with
expected
terms
of
12
months
or
less)
from
the
recognition
requirements
of
ASC
842,
and
has\nelected
to
account
for
lease
and
certain
non-lease
components
as
a
single
component.\nAt
December

2021,
the
Company
had

To

the
Company
has
not

Taxes\nThe
Company
uses
the
asset
and
liability
method
of
accounting
for
income
taxes.
Under
this
method,
deferred
tax
assets
and
liabilities
are
determined
based
on
temporary\ndifferences
between
the
financial
statement
carrying
amounts
and
tax
basis
of
assets
and
liabilities
using
enacted
tax
rates
in
effect
for
the
year
in
which
the
differences
are
expected\nto
reverse.
The
effect
on
deferred
tax
assets
and
liabilities
of
a
change
in
tax
rates
is
recognized
in
income
in
the
period
that
includes
the
enactment
date.
Valuation
allowances
are\nestablished
when
necessary
to
reduce
deferred
tax
assets
to
the
amount
expected
to
be
realized.\nThe
Company
recognizes
the
tax
benefit
from
uncertain
tax
positions
only
if
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
tax
positions
will
be
sustained
on
examination
by
the
tax\nauthorities,
based
on
the
technical
merits
of
the
position.
The
tax
benefit
is
measured
based
on
the
largest
benefit
that
has
a
greater
than
50%
likelihood
of
being
realized
upon\nultimate
settlement.
The
Company
recognizes
interest
and
penalties
related
to
income
tax
matters
in
income
tax
expense.\nFair
Value
of
Financial
Instruments\nThe
Company
applies
the
provisions
of
ASC
820,
Fair
Value
Measurements
and
Disclosures
(""ASC
820""),
which
provides
a
single
authoritative
definition
of
fair
value,\nsets
out
a
framework
for
measuring
fair
value
and
expands
on
required
disclosures
about
fair
value
measurement.
Fair
value
represents
the
exchange
price
that
would
be
received
for\nan
asset
or
paid
to
transfer
a
liability
in
the
principal
or
most
advantageous
market
for
the
asset
or
liability
in
an
orderly
transaction
between
market
participants
on
the
measurement\ndate.
The
Company
uses
the
following
hierarchy
in
measuring
the
fair
value
of
the
Company’s
assets
and
liabilities,
focusing
on
the
most
observable
inputs
when
available:\n•\nLevel
1
Quoted
prices
in
active
markets
for
identical
assets
or
liabilities.\n•\nLevel
2
Observable
inputs
other
than
Level
1
quoted
prices,
such
as
quoted
prices
for
similar
assets
and
liabilities
in
active
markets,
quoted
prices
in
markets
that
are\nnot
active
for
identical
or
similar
assets
and
liabilities,
or
other
inputs
that
are
observable
or
can
be
corroborated
by
observable
market
data
for
substantially
the
full
term\nof
the
assets
or
liabilities.\n•\nLevel
3
Valuations
are
based
on
inputs
that
are
unobservable
and
significant
to
the
overall
fair
value
measurement
of
the
assets
or
liabilities.
Inputs
reflect\nmanagement’s
best
estimate
of
what
market
participants
would
use
in
pricing
the
asset
or
liability
at
the
measurement
date.
Consideration
is
given
to
the
risk
inherent
in\nthe
valuation
technique
and
the
risk
inherent
in
the
inputs
to
the
model.\nValuation
techniques
used
to
measure
fair

must
maximize
the
use
of
observable
inputs
and
minimize
the
use
of
unobservable
inputs.

upon\nthe
achievement
of
certain

following
the

(the
“Earnout

Upon

any
unissued
Earnout

would
be
fully
issued
regardless
of
whether
the

Earnout
Shares
are
accounted
for
as
a
contingent

and
its
fair
value
is
determined
using
Level

inputs,
since
estimating
the
fair

requires
the
use
of
significant

inputs
that
may
and
are
likely
to
change
over
the
duration
of
the
liability
with

Recognition\nThe
Company
applies
ASC
606,
which
governs
how
the
Company
recognizes
revenue.\nUnder
ASC
606,
the
Company
recognizes
revenue
when
the
Company
transfers
promised
goods
or
services
to
customers
in
an
amount
that
reflects
the
consideration
to\nwhich
the
Company
expects
to
be
entitled
in
exchange
for
those
goods
or
services.
The
Company
recognizes
revenue
pursuant
to
the
five-step
framework
contained
in
ASC
606:
(i)\nidentify
the
contract
with
a
customer;
(ii)
identify
the
performance
obligations
in
the
contract,
including
whether
they
are
distinct
in
the
context
of
the
contract;
(iii)
determine
the\ntransaction
price,
including
the
constraint
on
variable
consideration;
(iv)
allocate
the
transaction
price
to
the
performance
obligations
in
the
contract;
and
(v)
recognize
revenue
when\n(or
as)
the
Company
satisfies
the
performance
obligations.\nDuring
2020,
the
Company's
revenue
was
derived
from
the
provision
of
consulting
services
on
a
project
basis.
The
Company's
fixed
price
contracts
related
to
these
services\ncontain
a
single
performance
obligation,
which
was
satisfied
in
July
2020
when
the
Company
provided
the
final
report
to
the
customer.
Revenue
for
these
services
was
recognized
at\na
point
in

when
the
project
was
delivered.\nSales
taxes
are
not
included
in

estimated

date
fair
value.
The
Company\nestimates
the
fair
value
of
its
share
options
using
the
Black-Scholes
option-pricing
model.
For
awards
that
vest
solely
based
on
continued
service
(“service-only
vesting\nconditions”),
the
resulting
fair
value
is
recognized
on
a
straight-line
basis
over
the
period
during
which
an
employee
is
required
to
provide
service
in
exchange
for
the
award,
usually\nthe
vesting
period,
which
is
generally
four
years.
The
Company
recognizes
the
fair
value
of
stock-based
awards
which
contain
performance
conditions
using
the
graded
vesting\nmethod,
when
it
is
probable
the
performance
condition
will
be
met.
The
Company
accounts
for
forfeitures
as
they
occur.
The
Company
classifies
stock-based
compensation
expense\nin
its
consolidated
statement
of
operations
in
the
same
manner
in
which
the
award
recipient’s
payroll
costs
are
classified.\nPrior
to
our
Business
Combination
on
December
21,
2020,
the
fair
value
of
our
RSUs
is
based
on
the
fair
value
of
the
Legacy
Canoo’s
ordinary
shares
on
the
date
of
grant.\nAs
there
is
no
public
market
for
the
Legacy
Canoo’s
ordinary
shares,
Legacy
Canoo,
with
the
assistance
of
a
third-party
valuation
specialist,
determined
the
fair
value
of
the
Legacy\nCanoo’s
ordinary
shares
at
the
time
of
the
grant
of
RSUs
by
considering
a
number
of
objective
and
subjective
factors,
including
the
likelihood
of
achieving
a
liquidity
event
and\ntransactions
involving
the
Legacy
Canoo’s
ordinary
shares,
among
other
factors.
The
fair
value
of
the
Legacy
Canoo’s
ordinary
shares
was
derived
from
the
Legacy
Canoo’s
total\nequity
value
divided
by
the
number
of
shares
outstanding
and
was
estimated
using
a
probability-weighted
expected
return
model,
using
different
probability
weightings
estimated\nfor
public
offering
scenario,
M&A
scenario
and
dissolution
scenario.
The
factors
and
scenario
weighting
estimates
require
significant
judgment
involve
inherent
uncertainties,\nwhich
can
materially
affect
the
estimate
of
the
fair
value
of
our
RSUs
and
ultimately
how
much
Stock-based
compensation
expense
is
recognized.\nAfter
December
21,
2020,
we
estimate
the
fair
value
of
RSUs
based
on
the
market
price
of
our
Common
Stock
underlying
the
awards
on
the
grant
date.
Fair
value
for\nawards
with
our
stock
price
performance
metrics
is
calculated
using
the
Monte
Carlo
simulation
model,
which
incorporates
stock
price
correlation
and
other
variables
over
the
time\nhorizons
matching
the
performance
periods.\nFor
the
years
ended
December
31,
2021
and
2020
total
stock-based
compensation
expense
was
$108.4
million
and
$84.3

Business
Combination\nOn
December
21,

we
consummated
the
Business
Combination.\nImmediately
prior
to
closing
of
the
Business
Combination,
each
Legacy
Canoo
preference
share
that
was
issued
and
outstanding
was
automatically
converted

to
be
the

acquirer
in

an

of
the

While
HCAC
was
the

in

because
Legacy
Canoo
was
deemed
the

acquirer,
for
accounting
purposes,
the

was
treated
as
a
recapitalization
of\nLegacy
Canoo
(i.e.,
a
capital
transaction
involving
the
issuance
of
stock
by
HCAC
for
the

Protection
Program
(the

(the
“PPP

administered
by\nthe
Small

Administration
(“SBA”)
established
under
Division
A,
Title
I
of
the
CARES
Act.
Loan
advance
proceeds
were
received
by
the
Company
in
April
2020,
and\ntherefore
were
accounted
for
as
a
financing
cash
inflow
in
the
consolidated
statement
of

for
the
twelve

ended
December

for
amounts
up
to
2.5
times
the
average
monthly

of
the

subject
to

The\nCompany
used
the
PPP
Loan
proceeds
for
purposes
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
PPP.
On
May
14,
2021,
the

repaid
its

in

which
was
accounted

Debt\nIn
August
2019,
Legacy
Canoo
issued
$100
million
aggregate
principal
amount
of
secured
convertible
notes
(the
“$100M
Notes”)
to
certain
existing
investors
in
Legacy\nCanoo.
The
$100M
Notes
accrued
simple
interest
at
12%
per
year.
Unless
earlier
repaid,
converted
or
extended
by
the
investors,
outstanding
principal
and
unpaid
accrued
interest\non
the
$100M
Notes
were
due
on
February
28,
2021
(“Maturity
Date”).
The
original
terms
of
the
$100M
Notes
stated
that
in
the
event
the
Company
consummates,
after
August
1,\n2019
and
on
or
prior
to
the
Maturity
Date,
an
equity
financing
pursuant
to
which
it
sells
shares
of
its
equity
securities
with
an
aggregate
sales
price
of
not
less
than
$200
million,\nexcluding
any
and
all
indebtedness
under
the
$100M
Notes
that
is
converted,
then
all
principal,
together
with
all
unpaid
accrued
interest
under
the
$100M
Notes,
would\nautomatically
convert
into
shares
of
the
equity
securities
at
80%
of
the
cash
price
per
share
paid
by
the
other
purchasers
of
equity
securities.\nIn
March
2020,
certain
terms
of
the
$100M
Notes
were
amended
such
that
(1)
the
Maturity
Date
was
extended
from
February
28,
2021
to
September
23,
2021
and
(2)
the\n$100M
Notes
are
automatically
converted
into
the
next
round
of
equity
securities
at
the
lesser
of
(a)
80%
of
the
cash
price
per
share
paid
by
the
other
purchasers
of
equity\nsecurities;
or
(b)
$500
million
divided
by
the
total
number
of
outstanding
shares
at
the
time
of
conversion.
In
addition,
the
amendment
provided
that
the
noteholders
can
elect
to\nconvert
the
$100M
Notes
if
there
is
a
change
in
control
after

and
(b)
$500\nmillion
divided
by
the
total

In
consideration
of
these
more
favorable
conversion
terms,
the
equity
holders
of

agreed
to
forgive

of
Contents\nThe
Company
accounted
for
these
changes
in
terms
of
its
$100M
Notes
as
a
debt
extinguishment.
The
Company
recognized
a
gain
on
extinguishment
of
$8.3
million
as
an\neffective
capital
contribution
within
additional
paid-in
capital
as
each
of
the
holders
of
the
$100M
Notes
were
existing
equity
holders
in
the
Company.
The
extinguishment
gain\nrepresents
the
difference
between:
(a)
the
sum
of
the
carrying
value
of
the
pre-amendment
$100M
Notes
of
$88.7
million,
the
value
of
unpaid
accrued
interest
through
the\namendment
date
of
$7.4
million,
and
the
fair
value
of
the
embedded
derivative
of
$17.7
million;
and
(b)
the
fair
value
of
the
amended
$100M
Notes
of
$105.6
million
at
the
time
of\nthe
amendment.\nPrior
to
the
March
23,
2020
amendment,
the
Company
had
not
elected
the
fair
value
option
to
record
the
notes
at
fair
value
in
its
entirety,
and
as
such
bifurcated
the\ncontingent
redemption
feature
embedded
in
the
$100M
Notes
and
recorded
it
at
fair
value
separately
as
an
embedded
derivative
liability.
The
fair
value
of
the
embedded
derivative\nliability
at
issuance
was
recorded
as
a
discount
to
the
$100M
Notes.
From
January
1,
2020
through
March
23,
2020,
Legacy
Canoo
recorded
expense
of
$2.6
million
for
the\naccretion
of
the
debt
discount
in
interest
expense.
Legacy
Canoo
assessed
the
fair
value
of
the
derivative
liability
as
of
March
23,
2020
and
determined
there
was
no
material
change\nin
the
fair
value
of
the
derivative
liability
from
December
31,
2019
through
the
March
23,
2020
amendment
date.\nAt
the
time
of
the
extinguishment,
Legacy
Canoo
elected
to
account
for
the
$100M
Notes
at
fair
value
in
their
entirety.
The
fair
value
of
the
$100M
Notes
on
March
23,\n2020
was
$105.6
million.
The
significant
unobservable
inputs
used
in
the
fair
value
measurement
of
the
$100M
Notes
were
the
financial
and
operational
performance
of
the\nCompany,
debt
issued
by
Legacy
Canoo
with
similar
terms,
and
the
probability
of
principal
recovery
of
the
investment.
The
difference
in
the
fair
value
as
compared
to
the
principal\nvalue
of
the
$100M
Notes
is
primarily
driven
by
the
difference
in
interest
rates
between
convertible
debt
issued
by
Legacy
Canoo
with
similar
terms.\nIn
March
2020,
Legacy
Canoo
issued
$15.0
million
aggregate
principal
amount
of
secured
convertible
notes
(the
“$15M
Notes”),
of
which
$10.0
million
was
issued
to\ncertain
existing
investors
in
Legacy
Canoo
and
the
remaining
$5.0
million
to
new
noteholders.
In
April
2020,
Legacy
Canoo
issued
$10.3
million
aggregate
principal
amount
of\nsecured
convertible
notes
(“$10.3M
Notes”)
to
new
noteholders.
The
$15M
Notes
and
the
$10.3M
Notes
accrue
simple
interest
at
8%
per
year.
Unless
earlier

converted
or\nextended
by
the
noteholders,
the
outstanding
principal
and
unpaid
accrued

and
the

are
due
on

event
Legacy

on
or
prior
to
the
maturity
date
of
the

pursuant
to

of
its

securities\nwith
an
aggregate
sales
price
of
not
less
than
$200
million,
excluding
any
and
all
indebtedness
under
the
note
that
is
converted,
then
all
principal,
together
with
all
unpaid
accrued\ninterest
under
the
notes,
shall
automatically
convert
into
shares
of
the
equity
securities
at
the
lesser
of
(a)
80%
of
the
cash
price
per
share
paid
by
the
other
purchasers
of
equity\nsecurities
or
(b)
the
price
obtained
by
dividing
$500
million
by
the
number
of
outstanding
shares.
In
addition,
the
noteholders
of
the
$15M
Notes
and
the
$10.3M
Notes
can
elect
to\nconvert
the
notes

lesser
of
(a)
80%

the
Company
and
(b)
$500
million\ndivided
by
the
total
number
of

at

At
the
date
of

Legacy
Canoo
assessed
the
fair
values
of
the
$15M
Notes
and
$10.3M
Notes
to\nbe
equal
to
the

of
these

of
$155.3
million
aggregate
principal
amount

which
$80.0

were
issued
to
certain
related
party
investors

remaining
$75.3
million
to

noteholders.
The
$155.3M
Notes
accrued
simple\ninterest
at
8%
per
year.
Other
than
the
change
in
the
interest
rate,
these
new
notes
had
the
same
terms
and
conditions
as
the
amended
$100M
Notes.
At

Legacy\nCanoo
assessed
the

Related
Party
Promissory
Note
and
Convertible
Debt\nIn
August
2019,
the
Company
issued
a
$100.0
million
aggregate
principal
amount
of
secured
convertible
notes
(the
“$100M
Notes”)
with
certain
existing
investors
in
the\nCompany.
The
$100M
Notes
accrue
simple
interest
at
12%
per
year.
Unless
earlier
repaid,
converted
or
extended
by
the
investors,
outstanding
principal
and
unpaid
accrued
interest\non
the
$100M
Notes
is
due
on
February
28,
2021,
which
was
subsequently
amended
to
September
23,
2021
(“Maturity
Date”).
The
automatic
conversion
feature
at
a
discount
to
the\nnext
equity
financing
represents
an
embedded
contingent
redemption
feature.
The
Company
has
bifurcated
the
contingent
redemption
feature
from
the
$100M
Notes
and
accounted\nfor
it
separately
as
an
embedded
derivative
liability.
The
embedded
derivative
liability
is
remeasured
to
fair
value
each
period.
The
embedded
contingent
redemption
feature
is\nbifurcated
from
the
$100M
Notes
because
(i)
a
separate
instrument
with
the
same
terms
as
the
embedded
derivative
would
be
a
derivative,
and
(ii)
the
economic
characteristics
of\nthe
embedded
contingent
redemption
feature
are
not
clearly
and
closely
related
to
$100M
Notes
as
it
is
contingently
exercisable
and
results
in
the
settlement
of
the
debt
at
a\nsubstantial
premium.\nThe
fair
value
of
the
embedded
derivative
liability
at
issuance
of
$17.8
million
was
recorded
as
a
discount
to
the
$100M
Notes.
To
estimate
the
fair
value
of
the
embedded\nderivative
liability,
management
considered
several
scenarios,
including
the
completion
of
an
equity
financing
prior
to
the
$100M
Notes’
maturity,
conversion
to
preference
shares\nupon
maturity
and
the
Company
defaulting
on
the
$100M
Notes,
and
the
timing
of
such
events.
The
fair
values
of
each
scenario
were
determined
primarily
by
the
terms
of
the\n$100M
Notes
and
the
value
of
the
Company’s
existing
preference
shares,
and
then
were
probability
weighted
based
on
management’s
estimates
of
the
likelihood
of
each
scenario.\nThe
probability
weighted
values
were
then
discounted
to
present
value.
The
discounted
carrying
amount
of
the
$100M
Notes
is
accreted,
using
the
effective
interest
method,
over\nthe
expected
term
of
the
$100M
Notes.
The
Company
performed
this
analysis
of
the
fair
value
of
the
embedded
derivative
liability
as
of
the
August
issuance
date.
As
of
December\n31,
2019,
the
Company
performed
its
fair
value
analysis
by
reconsidering
each
of
the
assumptions
in
the
fair
value
model
including
its
assessment
of
the
probability-weighted\nexpected
return
method
of
each
scenario
outlined
above.
Based
on
this
assessment,
the
Company
determined
that
there
were
no
material
changes
in
the
fair
value
of
the
embedded\nderivative
liability
from
issuance
to
December
31,
2019.
The
carrying
value
of
the
$100M
Notes
at
December
31,
2019
was
$86.1
million,
net
of
unamortized
debt
discount
of\n$13.9
million.
During
2019,
the
Company
recorded
interest
expense
of
$3.8
million
for
the
accretion
of
the
debt
discount.\nIn
March
2020,
certain
terms
of
the
$100M
Notes
were
amended
such
that
(1)
the
Maturity
Date
was
extended
from
February
28,
2021
to
September
23,
2021
and
(2)
the\n$100M
Notes
are
automatically
converted
into
the
next
round
of
equity
securities
at
the
lesser
of
(a)
80%
of
the
cash
price
per
share
paid
by
the
other
purchasers
of
equity\nsecurities;
or
(b)
$500
million
divided
by
the
total
number
of
outstanding
shares
at
the
time
of
conversion.
In
addition,
the
amendment
provided
that
the
noteholders
can
elect
to\nconvert
the
$100M
Notes
if
there
is
a
change
in
control
after
September
2020
at
the
lesser
of
(a)
80%
of
the
inferred
value
per
share
paid
for
control
of
the
Company
and
(b)
$500\nmillion
divided
by
the
total
number
of
outstanding
shares
at
the
time
of
conversion.
In
consideration
of
these
more
favorable
conversion
terms,
the
equity
holders
of
the
$100M\nNotes
agreed
to
forgive
all
unpaid
and
accrued
interest
through
the
amendment
date,
which
totaled
$7.4
million.
The
Company
accounted
for
these
changes
in
the
terms
of
its\n$100M
Notes
as
a
debt
extinguishment.
The
Company
recognized
a
gain
on
extinguishment
of
$8.3
million
as
an
effective
capital
contribution
within
additional
paid-in
capital
as\neach
of
the
holders
of
the
$100M
Notes
were
existing
equity
holders
in
the
Company.
The
extinguishment
gain
represents
the
difference
between:
(a)
the
sum
of
the
carrying
value\nof
the
pre-amendment
$100M
Notes
of
$88.7
million,
the
value
of
unpaid
accrued
interest
through
the
amendment
date
of
$7.4
million,
and
the
fair
value
of
the
embedded\nderivative
of
$17.7
million;
and
(b)
the
fair
value
of
the
amended
$100M
Notes
of
$105.6
million
at
the
time
of
the
amendment.\n97\n',

Document(page_content='Table
of

June
2021,
the
Torrance
lease
property
was
sold
to
a
non-related
party
lessor.
The
change
in
lessor
did
not
impact
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
Torrance
lease.
As\nsuch,
payments
made
to
the
new
landlord
after
June
2021
will
not
be
considered
as
a
related
party
lease
expense.\nThe
leases
contain
the
option
to
extend
the
terms
of
the
leases
for
two
additional
60-month
periods
and
one
additional
60-month
period,
respectively,
commencing
when
the\nprior

expires.
At
the
inception
of

of
the
leases,
it
was
not
reasonably
certain
we
would
exercise
any
of
the
options
to
extend
the
term
of
the
leases.
There
have
been
no\nchanges
to
that
assessment
as
of
December
31,
2021.\nThe
Company
has
determined
that
the
leases
do
not
effectively
transfer
control
of
the
underlying
facilities
to
the
Company
based
on
the
lease
terms
and,
accordingly,
the\nCompany
has
classified
the
leases
as
operating
leases.
As
such,
the
rent
and
property
taxes
are
expensed
on
a
straight-line
basis
in
the
consolidated
statements
of
operations.\nThe
Company
used
judgment
in
determining
an
appropriate
incremental
borrowing
rate
to
calculate
the
operating
lease
right-of-use
asset
and
operating
lease
liability
for\nthe
leases.
The
weighted
average
discount
rate
used
was
7.9%.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
remaining
operating
lease
ROU
asset
and
operating
lease
liability
were
approximately\n$14.2

and
$14.6
million,
respectively.
As
of
December
31,
2020,
the
operating
lease
ROU
asset
and
operating

were
approximately
$12.9

As

2021
and
2020,
$0.8

of

As
there
was
no\npublic

the
Legacy
Canoo’s
board

at
the
time
of
the

of

by
considering
information

CONTROLS
AND
PROCEDURES\nEvaluation
of
Disclosure
Controls
and
Procedures\nOur
management,
with
the
participation
of
our
Executive
Chair
and
Chief
Executive
Officer,
(""CEO"")
and
Interim
Chief
Financial
Officer
(""CFO"")
has
evaluated
the\neffectiveness
of
our
disclosure
controls
and
procedures
as
of
December
31,
2021.
We
have
established
and
currently
maintain
disclosure
controls
and
procedures,
as
such
term
is\ndefined
in
Rules
13a-15(e)
and
15d-15(e)
of
the
Exchange
Act,
designed
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
information
required
to
be
disclosed
in
our
reports
filed
under
the\nExchange
Act,
is
recorded,
processed,
summarized
and
reported
within
the
time
periods
specified
in
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission’s
rules
and
forms,
and
that
such\ninformation
is
accumulated
and
communicated
to
management,
including
our
principal
executive
officer
and
principal
financial
officer,
as
appropriate,
to
allow
for
timely
decisions\nregarding
required
disclosure.
In
designing
and
evaluating
disclosure
controls
and
procedures,
management
recognized
that
any
controls
and
procedures,
no
matter
how
well\ndesigned
and
operated,
can
provide
only
reasonable
assurance
of
achieving
the
desired
control
objectives,
and
management
necessarily
was
required
to
apply
its
judgment
in\nevaluating
the
cost-benefit
relationship
of
possible
controls
and
procedures.\nBased
on
an
evaluation
of
our
disclosure
controls
and
procedures,
our
CEO
and
CFO
concluded
that
our
disclosure
controls
and
procedures
were
effective
at
a
reasonable\nassurance
level
as
of
December
31,
2021.\nManagement’s
Report
on
Internal
Control
Over
Financial
Reporting\nManagement,
under
the
supervision
of
our
CEO
and
CFO,
is
responsible
for
establishing
and
maintaining
adequate
internal
control
over
our
financial
reporting,
as
defined\nin
Rules
13a-15(f)
and
15(d)-15(f)
under
the
Exchange
Act.
Our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
is
designed
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
regarding
the
reliability
of\nfinancial
reporting
and
the
preparation
of
financial
statements
for
external
purposes
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles.
Our
management,
under
the\nsupervision
of
our
CEO
and
CFO,
evaluated
the
design
and
operating
effectiveness
of
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
based
on
the
criteria
established
in
the
Internal\nControl-Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued
by
the
Committee
of
Sponsoring
Organizations
of
the
Treadway
Commission
(the
""2013
COSO
framework"").
Based
on
this\nevaluation,
our
management
concluded
that
we
maintained
effective
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
as
of
December
31,
2021.\nAll
internal
control
systems,
no
matter
how
well
designed,
have
inherent
limitations.
Accordingly
even
effective
internal
controls
and
procedures
can
provide
only\nreasonable
assurance
with
respect
to
financial
statement
preparation
and
presentation.
Also,
projections
of
any
evaluation
of
effectiveness
to
future
periods
are
subject
to
the
risk\nthat
controls
may
become
inadequate
because
of
changes
in
conditions,
or
that
the
degree
of
compliance
with
the
policies
or
procedures
may
deteriorate.\nThe
effectiveness
of
our
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
as
of
December
31,
2021
has
been
audited
by
Deloitte
&
Touche
LLP,
an
independent
registered

as
stated
in

Risk
Assessment:
We
did
not
have
an
effective
risk
assessment
process
that
defined
clear
financial
reporting
objectives,
that
identified
and
evaluated
risks
of\nmisstatement
due
to
errors
over
financial
reporting
processes,
or
that
developed
internal
controls
to
mitigate
those
risks.\nThe
material
weaknesses
in
the
design
and
maintenance
of
effective
controls
contributed
to
the
following
material
weaknesses:
(a)
Lack
of
formal
accounting
policies,\nprocesses
and
controls
to
analyze,
account
for
and
disclose
complex
transactions,
specifically
for
accounting
for
convertible
notes,
(b)
Lack
of
formal
accounting
policies,\nprocedures
and
controls
to
achieve
complete,
accurate
and
timely
financial
accounting,
reporting
and
disclosures,
including
controls
over
account
reconciliations
and
journal
entries,\nand
(c)
Lack
of
effective
controls
over
information
technology
(IT)
general
controls
for
information
systems
that
are
relevant
to
the
preparation
of
our
financial
statements,\nspecifically,
with
respect
to:
(i)
program
change
management
controls
to
ensure
that
IT
program
and
data
changes
affecting
financial
IT
applications
and
underlying
accounting\nrecords
are
identified,
tested,
authorized
and
implemented
appropriately;
(ii)
user
access
controls
to
ensure
appropriate
segregation
of
duties
and
that
adequately
restrict
user
and\nprivileged
access
to
financial
applications,
programs,
and
data
to
appropriate
company
personnel;
(iii)
computer
operations
controls
to
ensure
that
critical
batch
jobs
are
monitored\nand
data

are
authorized

continued
the
process
of
remediating
the\nmaterial
weaknesses.\nDuring
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
we
completed
our
plans
to
remediate
these
material
weaknesses
by
performing
the
following:\n•\nHired
experienced
executives
and
personnel
within
our
accounting
and
IT
functions
to
strengthen
the
Company's
expertise
and
segregate
key

on

audited
the

over

of

Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued
by
the
Committee
of
Sponsoring
Organizations
of
the
Treadway

In
our
opinion,
the
Company
maintained,
in\nall
material
respects,
effective
internal
control
over
financial

as
of
December
31,

have
also
audited,
in
accordance
with
the
standards
of
the
Public
Company
Accounting
Oversight
Board
(United
States)
(PCAOB),
the
consolidated

as
of\nand
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
of
the
Company
and
our
report
dated
March
1,
2022,
expressed
an
unqualified
opinion
on
those
financial
statements.\nBasis
for
Opinion\nThe
Company’s
management
is
responsible
for
maintaining
effective
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
and
for
its
assessment
of
the
effectiveness
of
internal
control
over\nfinancial
reporting,
included
in
the
accompanying
Management’s
Report
on
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting.
Our
responsibility
is
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
Company’s\ninternal
control
over
financial
reporting
based
on
our
audit.
We
are
a
public
accounting
firm
registered
with
the
PCAOB
and
are
required
to
be
independent
with
respect
to
the\nCompany
in
accordance
with
the
U.S.
federal
securities
laws
and
the
applicable
rules
and
regulations
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
and
the
PCAOB.\nWe
conducted
our
audit
in
accordance
with
the
standards
of
the
PCAOB.
Those
standards
require
that
we
plan
and
perform
the
audit
to
obtain
reasonable
assurance
about
whether\neffective
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
was
maintained
in
all
material
respects.
Our
audit
included
obtaining
an
understanding
of
internal
control
over
financial
reporting,\nassessing
the
risk
that
a
material
weakness
exists,
testing
and
evaluating
the
design
and
operating
effectiveness
of
internal
control
based
on
the
assessed
risk,
and
performing
such\nother
procedures
as
we
considered
necessary
in
the
circumstances.
We
believe
that
our
audit
provides
a
reasonable
basis
for
our
opinion.\nDefinition
and
Limitations
of
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting\nA
company’s
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
is
a
process
designed
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
regarding
the
reliability
of
financial
reporting
and
the
preparation
of\nfinancial
statements
for
external
purposes
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles.
A
company’s
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
includes
those
policies\nand
procedures
that
(1)
pertain
to
the
maintenance
of
records
that,
in
reasonable
detail,
accurately
and
fairly
reflect
the
transactions
and
dispositions
of
the
assets
of
the
company;
(2)\nprovide
reasonable
assurance
that
transactions
are
recorded
as
necessary
to
permit
preparation
of
financial
statements
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,\nand
that
receipts
and
expenditures
of
the
company
are
being
made
only
in
accordance
with
authorizations
of
management
and
directors
of
the
company;
and
(3)
provide
reasonable\nassurance
regarding
prevention
or
timely
detection
of
unauthorized
acquisition,
use,
or
disposition
of
the
company’s
assets
that
could
have
a
material
effect
on
the
financial\nstatements.\nBecause
of
its
inherent
limitations,
internal
control
over
financial
reporting
may
not
prevent
or
detect
misstatements.
Also,
projections
of
any
evaluation
of
effectiveness
to
future\nperiods
are
subject
to
the
risk
that
controls
may
become
inadequate
because
of
changes
in
conditions,
or
that
the
degree
of
compliance
with
the
policies
or
procedures
may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/

Compensation
Philosophy\nCanoo
is
currently
in
a
crucial
stage
of
growth
and
development,
with
important
near
term
goals,
including:
achieving
our
EV
production
targets
beginning
in
late
2022,\ndeveloping
industry-defining
automotive
software
products,
and
then
realizing
scaled
vehicle
production
levels
thereafter
that
will
drive
revenue
and
meaningful
shareholder
value\ncreation.
At
the
same
time,
competition
in
the
EV
and
automotive
sectors
is
intense
and
multi-faceted,
with
competitors
ranging
from
the
large
traditional
auto
manufacturers
to\nother
early-stage
EV
manufacturers
and
tech
companies
with
EV
and
autonomous
driving
aspirations.\nOur
Compensation
Committee
is
responsible
for
reviewing,
overseeing,
and
approving
Canoo’s
overall
compensation
strategy.
In
this
critical
time
of
development,
Canoo\ncontinues
to
invest
heavily
in
attracting,
retaining
and
motivating
an
experienced
and
highly
driven
leadership
team.
Our
current
executive
compensation
philosophy
is
focused
on
a\ntwo-pronged
approach:\n•\nDeveloping
near-term
compensation
practices
that
support
long-term
business
success:\n◦\nAttracting
and
motivating
top
tier
talent
that
can
deliver
on
highly
aggressive
performance
goals;\n◦\nManaging
compensation-related
cash
outlays
in
a
responsible
manner;
and\n◦\nEncouraging
achievement
of
near-term
milestones
that
set
the
stage
for
future
shareholder
success.\n•\nIncentivizing
long-term
positive
business
outcomes
that
deliver
outstanding
shareholder
value:\n◦\nAligning
long-term
executive
pay
with
shareholder
outcomes;
and\n◦\nEstablishing
aggressive
performance
objectives
for
the
CEO.\nIn
keeping
with
our
compensation
philosophy,
in
2021
Canoo
made
targeted
investments
in
key
talent
to
align
senior
executives
with
shareholder
growth
objectives\nthrough
equity
awards.
These
equity
awards
pay
for
performance
and
are
directly
tied
to
Canoo’s
transformational
mission.
When
Canoo
achieves
its
mission,
it
will
create
a
win-\nwin
opportunity
for
both
shareholders
and
the
Canoo
leadership
team.

and
achieving
significantly
positive

The
remainder
of
the
Post-IPO
Executive

with
shareholders
in
that
the
value
of
PSUs
and
RSUs\nincrease
or

In
addition,

price
of
$10

have
been
achieved.\nTransition

Tony
Aquila
in
the
full-time

for
the\ncompany.
In
connection
with
his
appointment
as
CEO,
Mr.

as
described
in\nmore

of
PSUs

of
$18,
$25,

Sheeran\nMs.
Sheeran
joined
Canoo
originally
as
a
Board
member
in
December
2020.
Her
extensive
experience
in
achieving
meaningful
business
results
with
key
government
and\nbusiness
partners
was
evident
from
her
earliest
days.
Given
her
key
strategic
importance
and
extensive
efforts
in
enabling
Canoo
in
establishing
key
foundations
for
manufacturing\nand
R&D
excellence,
Ms.
Sheeran
transitioned
from
being
a
non-employee
member
of
the
Board
to
President
of
the
Company
and
Board
member
on
July
26,
2021.
She
was\ninstrumental
in
achieving
critical
milestones
in
2021,
including
securing
$400
million
in
non-dilutive
financing
from
the
states
of
Arkansas
and
Oklahoma
to
support
facilities\ndevelopment.
Going
forward,
Ms.
Sheeran
is
expected
to
be
a
key
leader
of
Canoo’s
international
expansion
efforts,
as
well
as

in
its\nU.S.

as
President,
Ms.
Sheeran
received
a
base
salary
of
$490,000
and

RSUs
to
recognize
her
contributions
in
2021
and
reward
the
value
that
she
delivers
to
Canoo
over
time.
Given
the
complexity
of
Canoo’s
business
objectives
and\npotential
variability
in
future
business
results,
Canoo
elected
to
use
awards
that

with

PSUs,
computed
in

with
ASC
Topic
718.
This
amount
does\nnot
reflect
the
actual
economic
value
that

be
realized
by
the

which
will
depend
on
factors
including
the

of
the

and
the

value
of
our\nstock.
For
the

the
closing
price

probable
outcome
for
the
PSUs
awarded
to

2021
assuming
the
maximum
level
of\nperformance
is
achieved
is
$40,274,666.

fair
values
do
not
take
into

any

policy
before

our

takes
into
account
the

circumstances,
which

shall
approve
only
those
related-party
transactions
that,
in
light
of
known
circumstances,
are
in,
or
are
not
inconsistent
with,
the
best
interests
of
the\nCompany
and
our
stockholders,
as
our
Audit
Committee
determines
in

good
faith
exercise
of
its
discretion.\nIndemnification\nOur
Certificate
of
Incorporation
eliminates
our
directors’
liability
for
monetary
damages
to
the
fullest
extent
permitted
by
applicable
law.
The
DGCL
provides
that\ndirectors
of
a
corporation
will
not
be
personally
liable
for
monetary
damages
for
breach
of
their
fiduciary
duties
as
directors,
except
for
liability:\n•
for
any
transaction
from
which
the
director
derives
an
improper
personal
benefit;\n•
for
any
act
or
omission
not
in
good
faith

that
involves
intentional
misconduct

knowing
violation

or
any
unlawful
payment
of
dividends
or
redemption
of
shares;
or\n•
for
any
breach
of
a
director’s
duty
of
loyalty
to
the
corporation
or
its
stockholders.\nIf
the
DGCL
is
amended
to
authorize
corporate
action
further
eliminating
or
limiting
the
personal
liability
of
directors,
then
the
liability
of
our
directors
will
be
eliminated\nor
limited
to
the
fullest
extent
permitted
by
the
DGCL,
as
so
amended.\nThe
Certificate
of
Incorporation
requires
us
to
indemnify
and
advance
expenses
to,
to
the
fullest
extent
permitted
by
applicable
law,
our
directors,
officers
and
agents.
We\nmaintain
a
directors’
and
officers’
insurance
policy,
pursuant
to
which
our
directors
and
officers
are
insured
against
liability
for
actions
taken
in
their
capacities
as
directors
and\nofficers.
Finally,
the
Certificate
of
Incorporation
prohibits
any
retroactive
changes
to
the
rights
or
protections
or
increase
the
liability
of
any
director
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the\nalleged
occurrence
of
any
act
or
omission
to
act
giving
rise
to
liability
or
indemnification.\nIn
addition,
we
have
entered
into
separate
indemnification
agreements
with
each
of
our
directors
and
officers.
These
agreements,
among
other
things,
require
us
to\nindemnify
our
directors
and
officers
for
certain
expenses,
including
attorneys’
fees,
judgments,
fines
and
settlement
amounts
incurred
by
a
director
or
officer
in
any
action
or\nproceeding
arising
out
of
their

as
one
of
our
directors
or
officers
or
any
other
company
or
enterprise
to
which
the
person
provides
services
at
our
request.\nIndependence
of
the
Board
of
Directors\nAs
required
under
the
Nasdaq
listing
standards,
a
majority
of
the
members
of
a
listed
company’s
board
of
directors
must
qualify
as
“independent,”
as
affirmatively\ndetermined
by
the
board.
Our
Board
consults
with
our
counsel
to
ensure
that
its
determinations
are
consistent
with
relevant
securities
and
other
laws
and
regulations
regarding
the\ndefinition
of
“independent,”
including
those
set
forth
in
pertinent
listing
standards
of
Nasdaq,
as
in
effect
from
time
to
time.\nConsistent
with
these
considerations,
after
review
of
all
relevant
identified
transactions
or
relationships
between
each
director,
or
any
of
his
or
her
family
members,
and
us,\nour
senior
management
and
our
independent
auditors,
our
Board
has
affirmatively
determined
that
each
of
the
directors
on
the
Board
other
than
Tony
Aquila,
Josette
Sheeran
and\nGreg
Ethridge
are
independent
directors
within
the
meaning
of
the
applicable
Nasdaq
listing
standards.
In
making
this
determination,
our
Board
found
that
none
of
these
directors\nhad
a
material
or
other
disqualifying
relationship
with
our
company.\n132\n',

(the
“Warrant

which
is
filed
as

exhibit
to
our
Annual
Report
on
Form

and
is

herein.
During
any
period
when
we
will
have
failed
to
maintain
an
effective
registration
statement,
warrantholders
may
exercise
Public
Warrants
on
a
cashless
basis\npursuant
to
the
exemption
provided
by
Section
3(a)(9)
of
the
Securities
Act,
provided
that
such
exemption
is
available.
If
that
exemption,
or
another
exemption,
is
not
available,\nholders
will
not
be
able
to
exercise
their
Public
Warrants
on
a
cashless
basis.\nWe
may
call
the
Public
Warrants
for
redemption:\n•\nin
whole
and
not
in
part;\n•\nat
a
price
of
$0.01
per
Public
Warrant;\n•\nupon
not
less
than
30
days’
prior
written
notice
of
redemption
to
each
warrantholder;
and\n•\nif,
and
only
if,
the
reported
last
reported
sale
price
of
the
Common
Stock
equals
or
exceeds
$18.00
per
share
(as
adjusted
for
stock
splits,
stock
dividends,\nreorganizations,
recapitalizations
and
the
like)
for
any
20
trading
days
within
a
30-trading
day
period
ending
three
business
days
before
we
send
the
notice
of\nredemption
to
the
warrantholders.\nIf
and
when
the
Public
Warrants
become
redeemable
by
us,
we
may
not
exercise
our
redemption
right
if
the
issuance
of
shares
of
Common
Stock
upon
exercise
of
the\nPublic
Warrants
is
not
exempt
from
registration
or
qualification
under
applicable
state
blue
sky
laws
or
we
are
unable
to
effect
such
registration
or
qualification.
We
will
use
our\nbest
efforts
to
register
or
qualify
such
shares
of
Common
Stock
under
the
blue
sky
laws
of
the
state
of
residence
in
those
states
in
which
the
Public
Warrants
were
offered
by
us\nin
this
offering.\nWe
have
established
the
last
of
the
redemption
criteria
discussed
above
to
prevent
a
redemption
call
unless
there
is
at
the
time
of
the
call
a
significant
premium
to
the\nwarrant
exercise
price.
If
the
foregoing
conditions
are
satisfied
and
we
issue
a
notice
of
redemption
of
the
Public
Warrants,
each
warrantholder
will
be
entitled
to
exercise
its\nPublic
Warrants
prior
to
the
scheduled
redemption
date.
However,
the
price
of
the
Common
Stock
may
fall
below
the
$18.00
redemption
trigger
price
(as
adjusted
for
stock\nsplits,
stock
dividends,
reorganizations,
recapitalizations
and
the
like)
as
well
as
the
$11.50
warrant
exercise
price
after
the
redemption
notice
is
issued.\nIf
we
call
the
Public
Warrants
for
redemption
as
described
above,
our
management
will
have
the
option
to
require
any
holder
that
wishes
to
exercise
its
warrant
to
do\nso
on
a
“cashless
basis.”
In
determining
whether
to
require
all
holders
to
exercise
their
Public
Warrants
on
a
“cashless
basis,”
our
management
will
consider,
among
other\nfactors,
our
cash
position,
the
number
of
Public
Warrants
that
are
outstanding
and
the
dilutive
effect
on
our
stockholders
of
issuing
the
maximum
number
of
shares
of
Common\nStock
issuable
upon
the
exercise
of
our
Public
Warrants.
If
our
management
takes
advantage
of
this
option,
all
holders
of
Public
Warrants
would
pay
the
exercise
price
by\nsurrendering
their
Public
Warrants
for
that
number
of
shares
of
Common
Stock
equal
to
the
quotient
obtained
by
dividing
(x)
the
product
of
the
number
of
shares
of
Common\nStock
underlying
the
Public
Warrants,
multiplied
by
the
difference
between
the
exercise
price
of
the
Public
Warrants
and
the
“fair
market
value”
(defined
below)
by
(y)
the
fair\nmarket
value.
The
“fair
market
value”
shall
mean
the
average
last
reported
sale
price
of
the
Common
Stock
for
the
10
trading
days
ending
on
the
third
trading
day
prior
to
the\ndate
on
which
the
notice
of
redemption
is
sent
to
the
holders
of
the
Public
Warrants.
If
our
management
takes
advantage
of
this
option,
the
notice
of
redemption
will
contain
the\ninformation
necessary
to
calculate
the
number
of
shares
of
Common
Stock
to
be
received
upon
exercise
of
the
Public
Warrants,
including
the
“fair
market
value”
in
such
case.\nRequiring
a
cashless
exercise
in
this
manner
will
reduce
the
number
of
shares
of
Common
Stock
to
be
issued
and
thereby
lessen
the
dilutive
effect
of
a
warrant
redemption.
We\nbelieve
this
feature
is
an
attractive
option
to
us
if
we
do
not
need
the
cash
from
the
exercise
of
the
Public
Warrants
after
the
Business
Combination.\nA
holder
of
a
Public
Warrant
may
notify
us
in
writing
in
the
event
it
elects
to
be
subject
to
a
requirement
that
such
holder
will
not
have
the
right
to
exercise
such
Public\nWarrants,
to
the
extent
that
after
giving
effect
to
such
exercise,
such
person
(together
with
such
person’s
affiliates),
to
the
warrant
agent’s
actual
knowledge,
would
beneficially\nown
in
excess
of
4.9%
or
9.8%
(or
such
other
amount
as
a
holder
may
specify)
of
the
shares
of
Common
Stock
outstanding
immediately
after
giving
effect
to
such
exercise.\nIf
the
number
of
outstanding
shares
of
Common
Stock
is
increased
by
a
stock
dividend
payable
in
shares
of
Common
Stock,
or
by
a
split-up
of
shares
of
Common\nStock
or
other
similar
event,
then,
on
the
effective
date
of
such
stock
dividend,
split-up
or
similar
event,
the
number
of
shares
of
Common
Stock
issuable
on
exercise
of
each\nPublic
Warrant
will
be
increased
in
proportion
to
such
increase
in
the
outstanding
shares
of
Common
Stock.

the
registered
holder
of
the
Public
Warrant
properly
exercises
the
Public
Warrant
within
thirty
days
following
public\ndisclosure
of

transaction,
the
warrant
exercise
price
will
be
reduced
as
specified
in
the
Warrant
Agreement
based
on
the
Black-Scholes
value
(as
defined
in
the
Warrant\nAgreement)
of
the
Public
Warrant.
The
purpose
of
such
exercise
price
reduction
is
to
provide
additional
value
to
holders
of
the
Public
Warrants
when
an
extraordinary\ntransaction
occurs
during
the
exercise
period
of
the
Public
Warrants
pursuant
to
which
the
holders
of
the
Public
Warrants
otherwise
do
not
receive
the
full
potential
value
of
the\nPublic
Warrants
in
order
to
determine
and
realize
the
option
value
component
of
the
Public
Warrant.
This
formula
is
to
compensate
the
Public
Warrant
holder
for
the
loss
of
the\noption
value
portion
of
the
Public
Warrant
due
to
the
requirement
that
the
Public
Warrant
holder
exercise
the
Public
Warrant
within
30
days
of
the
event.
The
Black-Scholes\nmodel
is
an
accepted
pricing
model
for
estimating
fair
market
value
where
no
quoted
market
price
for
an
instrument
is
available.\nThe
Warrant
Agreement
provides
that
the
terms
of
the
Public
Warrants
may
be
amended
without
the
consent
of
any
holder
to
cure
any
ambiguity
or
correct
any\ndefective
provision,
but
requires
the
approval
by
the
holders
of
at
least
65%
of
the
then
outstanding
Public
Warrants
to
make
any
change
that

may
deter
or
impede
hostile
takeovers
or
changes
of
control
or
management.
These
provisions\ninclude:\n•\nIssuance
of
Undesignated
Preferred
Stock:
Our
board
of
directors
has
the
authority,
without
further
action
by
the
stockholders,
to
issue
up
to
10,000,000
shares
of\nundesignated
preferred
stock
with
rights
and
preferences,
including
voting
rights,
designated
from
time
to
time
by
our
board
of
directors.
The
existence
of
authorized
but\nunissued
shares
of
preferred
stock
enables
our
board
of
directors
to
make
it
more
difficult
to
attempt
to
obtain
control
of
us
by
means
of
a
merger,
tender
offer,
proxy\ncontest
or
otherwise.\n•\nClassified
Board:
Our
Restated
Certificate
and
Restated
Bylaws
provide
for
a
classified
board
of
directors
consisting
of
three
classes
of
directors,
with
staggered
three-\nyear
terms.
Only
one
class
of
directors
will
be
elected
at
each
annual
meeting
of
our
stockholders,
with
the
other
classes
continuing
for
the
remainder
of
their
respective\nthree-year
terms.
This
provision
may
have
the
effect
of
delaying
a
change
in
control
of
our
board.\n•\nBoard
of
Directors
Vacancies:
Our
Restated
Certificate
and
Restated
Bylaws
authorize
only
our
board
of
directors
to
fill
vacant
directorships.
In
addition,
the
number
of\ndirectors
constituting
our
board
of
directors
may
be
set
only
by
resolution
adopted
by
a
majority
vote
of
our
entire
board
of
directors.
These
provisions
prevent
a\nstockholder
from
increasing
the
size
of
our
board
of
directors
and
gaining
control
of
our
board
of
directors
by
filling
the
resulting
vacancies
with
its
own
nominees.\n•\nStockholder
Action;
Special
Meetings
of
Stockholders:
Our
Restated
Certificate
provides
that
our
stockholders
may
not
take
action
by
written
consent
but
may
only\ntake
action
at
annual
or
special
meetings
of
our
stockholders.
Our
Restated
Bylaws
provide
that
only
the
chairperson
of
our
board
of
directors,
our
chief
executive\nofficer,
or
a
majority
of
our
board
of
directors
may
call
special
meetings
of
our
stockholders.\n•\nAdvance
Notice
Requirements
for
Stockholder
Proposals
and
Director
Nominations:
Our
Restated
Bylaws
provide
advance
notice
procedures
for
stockholders
seeking\nto
bring
business
before
our
annual
meeting
of
stockholders,
or
to
nominate
candidates
for
election
as
directors
at
our
annual
meeting
of
stockholders.
Our
Restated\nBylaws
also
specify
certain
requirements
as
to
the
form
and
content
of
a
stockholder’s
notice.
These
provisions
may
make
it
more
difficult
for
our
stockholders
to
bring\nmatters
before
our
annual
meeting
of
stockholders
or
to
nominate
directors
at
annual
meetings
of
stockholders.\nExclusive
Forum
Selection\nOur
Restated
Certificate
provides
that
the
Court
of
Chancery
of
the
State
of
Delaware
will
be
the
exclusive
forum
for
the
following
types
of
actions
or
proceedings\nunder
Delaware
statutory
or
common
law:
(i)
any
derivative
action
or
proceeding
brought
on
our
behalf;
(ii)
any

or

(including
any
class
action)
asserting
a\nclaim
of
breach
of
fiduciary

owed
by
any

or

to
us
or
our
stockholders;
(iii)

asserting
a

against
us
or
any
director
or

or

that
is
governed
by

This
provision
would
not\napply

or
any

Where
Will
Canoo
Stock
Be
in
1
Year?
The
very
first
bullet
point
in
Canoo's(NASDAQ:
GOEV)
third-quarter
2023
earnings
release
stated
that
the
electric
vehicle
(EV)
company
had
reached
the
""accelerating
revenue
generation
phase.""
That
sounds
great,
and
if
you
look
at
the
income
statement,
it
is
clearly
true.
But
there's
still
one
small
nuance
to
consider
if
you
examine
the
company's
10-Q
filing.
Canoo
finally
has
some
income
In
the
third
quarter
of
2023,
Canoo
generated
$519,000
of
revenue,
compared
to
zero
in
the
prior
year
period.
In
fact,
if
you
look
back
through
the
company's
short
history
(it
went
public
through
a
merger
with
a
special
purpose
acquisition
company
in
December
2020),
the
third
quarter
of
2023
was
the
first
time
it
generated
any
revenue
at
all.
Image
source:
Getty
Images.
To
give
credit
where
credit
is
due,
the
third
quarter
was
a
big
improvement.
Until
now,
the
company
has
just
been
trying
to
build
its
business.
Getting
to
this
point
was
no
small
feat,
given
that
creating
an
EV
company
from,
effectively,
scratch
is
both
difficult
and
expensive.
That
said,
there
are
still
some
problems
investors
need
to
consider.
For
example,
while
it
generated
$519,000
in
revenue,
the
cost
of
revenue
tallied
up
to
$903,000.
So,
the
company's
gross
profit
was
negative.
On
top
of
that,
the
company
is
still
spending
a
lot
of
money
to
build
out
its
business.
For
example,
research
and
development
spending
came
in
at
$21.9
million,
and
selling,
general,
and
administrative
expenses
were
$24.9
million.
Canoo
continues
to
burn
through
cash.
That
is
why,
despite
entering
the
""accelerating
revenue
generation
phase,""
the
company's
10-Q
for
the
third
quarter
still
contained
a
going
concern
warning.
This
is
a
warning
from
a
company
that
it
may
be
unable
to
survive
the
next
12
months
because
of
its
weak
financial
condition.
Here's
what
the
filing
said:
The
Company
expects
to
continue
to
incur
net
losses
and
negative
cash
flows
from
operating
activities
in
accordance
with
its
operating
plan
and
expects
that
both
capital
and
operating
expenditures
will
increase
significantly
in
connection
with
its
ongoing
activities.
These
conditions
and
events
raise
substantial
doubt
about
the
Company's
ability
to
continue
as
a
going
concern.
Canoo's
situation
remains
risky
There's
no
way
to
predict
the
future,
but
Canoo
is
clearly
not
starting
from
a
position
of
strength.
It
is
highly
likely
to
need
to
sell
equity
or
issue
debt
to
continue
to
fund
its
business
efforts.
This
isn't
a
maybe.
It's
a
certainty.
The
company
noted
in
the
third-quarter
2023
earnings
release:
As
of
September
30,
2023,
we
had
cash
and
cash
equivalents
of
$8.3
million.
After
giving
effect
to
the
preferred
stock
and
warrant
subscription
agreement
for
a
total
of
$45.0
million,
our
cash
balance
would
have
been
$53.3
million
on
September
30,
2023.
Put
into
plain
English,
the
company
doesn't
have
nearly
enough
cash
on
hand,
but
it
has
agreements
to
sell
preferred
stock
and
warrants
that
will
allow
it
to
raise
some
much-needed
money.
Finally
generating
some
revenue
is
good
news,
but
there
needs
to
be
a
drastic
""acceleration""
on
the
top
line
before
Canoo
will
be
able
to
self-fund
its
business.
And
since
a
going
concern
warning
looks
out
12
months,
the
next
year
isn't
likely
to
see
the
company's
financial
situation
change
much.
The
worst
part
of
all
this
is
likely
that
at
some
point
in
the
future,
Canoo
will
have
to
issue
shares
to
cover
the
convertibles
and
warrants
it
is
relying
on
to
generate
cash
today.
That
means
current
shareholders
could
potentially
suffer
massive
amounts
of
dilution
before
Canoo
gets
its
business
profitable
(if
it
ever
manages
to).
The
risk/reward
trade-off
looks
pretty
ugly
right
now,
and
only
the
most
aggressive
investors
should
be
looking
at
Canoo.
Canoo
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
By
Canoo's
own
admission,
the
next
year
will
be
hard
financially.
Buying
the
stock
today
means
you
must
not
only
believe
strongly
that
it
can
actually
build
a
profitable
business
but
also
be
willing
to
suffer
more
losses
until
it
does.
And
even
then,
you
will
likely
see
material
dilution
as
the
company
has
to
make
good
on
the
convertibles
and
warrants
it
has
been
using
to
fund
its
massive
capital
needs.
All
but
the
most
aggressive
investors
would
probably
be
better
off
watching
the
company's
progress
over
the
next
year
than
buying
it.
That
will
remain
true
at
least
until
the
going
concern
warning
is
removed
from
the
company's
filings
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission.
